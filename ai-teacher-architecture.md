### 3. Detailed Module Descriptions (Kindergarten Focus)

*   **3.1. Curriculum Engine**
    *   **Purpose:** To curate, manage, and deliver developmentally appropriate learning content for Kindergarten.
    *   **Kindergarten Content Areas:**
        *   **Early Reading:** Phonological awareness (rhyming, alliteration, syllable segmentation), letter recognition (uppercase and lowercase), basic vocabulary acquisition, and early comprehension skills (listening to stories, answering simple questions).
        *   **Early Writing:** Pre-writing skills (tracing, drawing shapes), letter formation (starting with uppercase), and name writing.
        *   **Counting & Math:** Number recognition (0-10+), one-to-one correspondence, basic concepts (more/less, bigger/smaller), and pattern recognition.
        *   **Integration with `level-0-goals.md`:** Activities will be designed to foster Creative Imagination (e.g., storytelling prompts), Scientific Exploration (e.g., observing patterns in nature through illustrated content), and Storytelling (e.g., interactive narratives).
    *   **Content Delivery:** Micro-lessons presented as interactive games, animated stories, digital manipulatives, and engaging demonstrations.

*   **3.2. Student Interaction Interface**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide an intuitive, engaging, and accessible way for Kindergarten children to interact with the AI Teacher.
    *   **Key Features (Kindergarten):**
        *   **Voice-first:** Primary mode of interaction using clear, friendly, and child-appropriate voice output. Robust speech recognition tolerant of young children's speech patterns.
        *   **Visually Rich and Engaging:** Colorful graphics, appealing animations, minimal on-screen text, and large, easy-to-tap interactive elements.
        *   **Positive Feedback & Reinforcement:** Frequent verbal praise (e.g., "Great job!", "You're a super star!"), visual rewards (e.g., stars, animations), and gentle, encouraging correction for mistakes.
        *   **Pacing and Patience:** Ample time for children to respond, no rushing, and options for repeating instructions or activities.

*   **3.3. Personalization Engine**
    *   **Purpose:** To tailor the learning journey to each child's individual pace, learning style (rudimentary at Level 0), and emerging interests.
    *   **Mechanisms (Kindergarten):**
        *   Tracks mastery of micro-milestones in reading (e.g., identifies 5 uppercase letters), writing (e.g., traces a circle), and counting (e.g., counts 5 objects accurately).
        *   Adjusts the pace of instruction, difficulty of tasks (e.g., number of items to count), and sequence of content based on performance.
        *   Recommends activities based on demonstrated interest (e.g., if a child engages more with animal-themed counting games) and rudimentary learning style indicators (e.g., preference for visual vs. auditory presentation).
        *   Provides scaffolding (e.g., visual hints for letter formation) and varied reinforcement strategies.

*   **3.4. Assessment & Documentation Module**
    *   **Purpose:** To continuously assess learning in a non-intrusive manner and document progress for review by facilitators.
    *   **Methods (Kindergarten):**
        *   Tracks task completion rates, accuracy on activities, and engagement metrics (e.g., time spent on task, frequency of interaction) for reading, writing, and counting activities.
        *   Supports tracking of numerous micro-milestones (aiming for 10+ per day, depending on activity).
        *   Generates simple, visual reports for facilitators highlighting areas of strength and areas needing more support.
        *   Potential for creating a digital portfolio of the child's work (e.g., drawings, recordings of them reading).

*   **3.5. Facilitator Interface (Human Teacher Support Module)**
    *   **Purpose:** To empower human teachers and caregivers with actionable insights and tools to complement the AI's instruction.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Student Progress Dashboards:** Clear, visual summaries of each child's progress against Level 0 goals and micro-milestones.
        *   **Alerts for Intervention Needs:** Notifications when a child is struggling with a concept or disengaging.
        *   **Suggestions for Complementary Offline Activities:** Recommendations for hands-on activities that reinforce concepts learned with the AI (e.g., "Practice writing letter 'A' with playdough").
        *   **Supports AI-Human Collaboration Models:** Provides information to support teachers in AI-Led, Balanced, or Human-Led interaction models.

### 4. Integration with Existing Project Structure
