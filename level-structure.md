# Learning Protocol Level Structure

## Level Progression System

The Learning Protocols system uses a level-based progression framework that directly aligns with traditional grade levels. This structure begins with Level 0 (ages 6 and under, covering Pre-K and Kindergarten) and progresses through Level 12 (12th Grade), with a focus on mastery and developmental appropriateness.
