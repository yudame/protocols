# Financial Infrastructure in the Solomon Islands: From Cash to Crypto

## Executive Summary

The Solomon Islands presents one of the most dramatic financial inclusion stories unfolding in the Pacific today. In a nation where **80% of all transactions are conducted in cash** and only **25% of the population has a bank account**, a mobile money service called M-SELEN launched in June 2023 and reached **350,000 users within two years**—nearly half the entire population. This leapfrogging phenomenon, where mobile phones bypass traditional banking infrastructure entirely, offers crucial lessons for understanding how financial systems evolve in remote, geographically fragmented economies.

For a telecommunications company considering market entry, the Solomon Islands represents both opportunity and challenge: **75% of the population lacks bank accounts, but 70% have mobile phones**. Closing that gap defines the opportunity—and requires understanding the complex interplay of cash culture, remittance flows, utility payments, regulatory frameworks, and emerging digital solutions including a Central Bank Digital Currency pilot called Bokolo Cash.

## The Cash Economy: Why 80% of Transactions Never Touch a Bank

### Geographic Reality: 900 Islands, 15 Bank Branches

The Solomon Islands' financial exclusion isn't a mystery—it's geography. The nation spans **nearly 1,000 islands across 1,500 kilometers of ocean**, with approximately **76% of the population living in rural areas**. Against this backdrop, the entire country operates with just:

- **15 bank branches** (over 70% located in Honiara, the capital)
- **59 ATMs** (83% concentrated in Honiara)
- **423 EFTPOS terminals** (72% in Honiara)
- **Four commercial banks**: Bank of South Pacific (BSP), ANZ, BRED Bank, and Pan Oceanic Bank

The average cost to travel one-way to a financial access point is **US$8.67**, with **30% of customers using boats or canoes** to reach banking services. Average travel time to a bank agent in rural areas: **nearly 70 minutes** (versus 22 minutes in neighboring Fiji).

This concentration explains why even those with bank accounts treat them primarily as cash dispensaries: **over 90% of card transactions occur at ATMs**, almost entirely for cash withdrawals rather than payments.

### The Exclusion Numbers

Financial inclusion statistics reveal the scale of the gap:

- **25% of the population** owns a bank account
- **34%** access any formal financial services
- **35%** rely on informal moneylenders and savings clubs
- **31%** are completely excluded from all financial services
- **Women face a 12% gender gap** in account ownership

As of 2020, approximately **150,000 active bank account users** existed nationwide—serving a population of 740,000.

## M-SELEN: The Mobile Money Revolution

### From Zero to 350,000 Users in Two Years

The watershed moment came in June 2023 when Our Telekom—the dominant telecommunications provider with **60-80% mobile market share**—launched M-SELEN (meaning "mobile money" in local Pijin, where *selen* means money). Supported by the Australian government and UNCDF, the service achieved remarkable growth:

| Metric | Launch (June 2023) | Early 2025 |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Registered Users | 20,000 | 350,000 |
| Agent Network | 250 | 3,000+ |

This represents roughly **half the entire population** signing up for mobile money in under two years—a testament to latent demand for financial services.

### How M-SELEN Works

The service operates via USSD code (*673# or *123#), meaning it works on **any phone**—not just smartphones. Features include:

- Cash-in/cash-out at agent locations
- Person-to-person (P2P) transfers
- Mobile airtime top-ups
- Utility bill payments (electricity, water)
- Merchant payments via QR code
- International remittance receiving (via KlickEx and Ria partnerships)

The USSD approach is critical: in a country where **only 25% of the population has 4G coverage**, 20% has 3G, and **50% relies on 2G/GSM networks**, smartphone-only apps would exclude the majority.

### The Agent Network: The Real Infrastructure

The expansion from 250 to 3,000+ agents represents the actual financial infrastructure buildout. These agents—typically existing shopkeepers, airtime vendors, and community stores—provide the physical cash-in/cash-out points that make digital money usable in a cash economy.

Trust is built through personal relationships. Rural Solomon Islanders may be wary of depositing cash with a distant institution, but they trust an M-SELEN agent who is a known shopkeeper in their community. This mirrors patterns seen in Kenya's M-Pesa success and Papua New Guinea's slower mobile money adoption.

### Competing Mobile Money Services

M-SELEN isn't alone, though it dominates:

**EziPei** (launched February 2020): Operated by Solomon Post using patented SIM-Skin technology that works across networks. Notably enables prepaid electricity (Cashpower) purchases for Solomon Power. Approximately 50 agents.

**IumiCash** (launched January 2021): A QR-based, smartphone-only fintech startup. Received a Money Transfer Operator license from CBSI in 2023. Targeting urban youth segment with app-based payments.

**Bank Mobile Banking**: BSP offers USSD mobile banking (*131# on Telekom, *134# on bmobile) for existing account holders. BRED Bank has a Solomon Connect app with QR payments. These serve the already-banked urban population.

As of July 2023, approximately **13,400 mobile wallet accounts** existed across all platforms—**only 10-15% were active users**. M-SELEN's subsequent explosive growth suggests it cracked the adoption barrier that others couldn't.

## Utility Payments: The Gateway Use Case

### Solomon Power: Prepaid Electricity as Financial Infrastructure

Many Solomon Islands households use **Cashpower prepaid meters**—customers purchase electricity tokens and key them into meters to activate power. This prepaid model mirrors the airtime top-up behavior that drives telecom revenue and creates a natural bridge to digital payments.

Traditional payment channels required visiting Solomon Power offices with cash or using EFTPOS machines (available only in urban centers). The digital shift is underway:

- **EziPei**: Authorized to sell prepaid electricity tokens through its app—enter meter number, pay from e-wallet balance, receive token via SMS
- **M-SELEN**: Integrated electricity payments in 2023, allowing anyone with the wallet to top-up power without traveling to an office

For rural villages recently electrified with solar or micro-grids, this is transformative—instead of periodic visits by Solomon Power staff, villagers can purchase electricity tokens anytime via phone.

**Critical context**: Only **14-16% of the population has electricity access**. The World Bank-funded Solomon Islands Electricity Access and Renewable Energy Expansion Project is expanding coverage, creating new digital payment customers as it goes.

### Solomon Water: Post-Paid Goes Digital

Solomon Water operates **CashWater prepaid systems** in some areas and post-paid monthly billing in others. In October 2023, Solomon Water partnered with Our Telekom to integrate water payments into M-SELEN, enabling:

- Purchasing CashWater (prepaid) tokens via mobile wallet
- Paying post-paid water bills from the platform

Solomon Water serves approximately **17,000 customer connections** across Honiara and provincial towns—all potential M-SELEN users.

### YouSave LoMobile: Airtime as Pension Savings

Perhaps the most innovative integration is **YouSave LoMobile**, launched in 2017 by the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SINPF). This world-first allows **mobile airtime top-ups to convert directly into pension savings**.

The mechanism: dial a USSD code, confirm an amount (SBD 10-1,000), and that value transfers from your prepaid airtime balance to your SINPF retirement account. This targets informal sector workers who would never visit a pension office but regularly top up their phones.

The model proves that telecom rails can enable financial services far beyond payments—and demonstrates regulatory acceptance of airtime distribution channels for formal financial services.

## Remittances: The $431 Million Opportunity

### Record-Breaking Flows in 2024

International remittances to the Solomon Islands hit a record **SBD 431-475 million (approximately US$55-89 million) in 2024**, representing a **68% increase** from the previous year. These flows now constitute the **third-largest foreign exchange earner** after logging and cocoa exports.

The growth driver: labor mobility programs. As of mid-2024:

- **7,600+ Solomon Islanders** work under Australia's PALM scheme (Pacific Australia Labour Mobility)
- **1,100+ workers** in New Zealand's RSE scheme (Recognised Seasonal Employer)
- Combined **~8,700 seasonal workers** deployed abroad
- **15,000+ in queue** for placement
- Government target: **16,000 workers by 2028**

Solomon Islands is now the **largest Pacific source country** for Australia's PALM scheme.

### The Cost Crisis: 11% Average Fees

Sending money to the Solomon Islands costs approximately **11.1% of the transfer amount**—roughly **four times the global average** of 6.35% and nearly four times the UN Sustainable Development Goal target of 3%.

Sending AUD $500 from Australia to Solomon Islands costs anywhere from **3.2% to 15%** depending on provider and method. This premium derives from:

- Cash-to-cash service dominance (highest operational overhead)
- Limited provider competition
- Compliance costs from bank de-risking
- Hidden exchange rate margins layered on top of visible fees

### Current Remittance Channels

**Western Union**: The dominant formal provider, operating through agent locations concentrated in urban centers (Honiara, Auki, Munda). Recipients collect cash in person with valid ID. Until recently, coverage was limited to a handful of towns.

**KlickEx**: New Zealand-based digital platform now partnered with M-SELEN for direct mobile wallet transfers. Multiple priority services with varying speeds and exchange rates. No explicit transfer fees (margin built into exchange rate).

**Ria Money Transfer**: Partnership with M-SELEN announced in 2025 enabling remittances from **200+ countries** directly to mobile wallets.

**Bank Transfers**: BSP and ANZ offer international transfers. ANZ charges AUD$7 flat fee for Pacific transfers under AUD$10,000—prohibitively expensive for small amounts.

### The Informal Economy of Remittances

A huge portion of remittances move through informal channels. **72% of domestic (internal) remittances** are conducted via cash carried by someone—bus driver, boat, or hand-delivery—rather than any formal service. Internationally, informal sending occurs whenever there's opportunity (community members returning from Australia carry funds for friends).

The friction points beyond cost:
- Limited agent locations outside Honiara
- Identification requirements (many rural residents lack formal ID)
- Cash-out challenges in remote areas
- Difficulties accessing Australian superannuation for returning seasonal workers

## The Regulatory Landscape: Proactive but Cautious

### Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) as Champion

CBSI has led three successive National Financial Inclusion Strategies since 2011. The current **NFIS3 (2021-2025)** sets explicit targets:

- Increase active financial accounts from 283,954 to **400,000** (50% women)
- Expand access points from 825 to **1,155**

These government-mandated targets create clear opportunity for private sector investment that contributes to national goals.

### National Payment Systems Act 2022

This landmark legislation provides the legal foundation for:
- Payment system modernization and CBSI oversight
- Licensing of payment service providers
- Consumer protection frameworks
- Interoperability requirements

Under this Act, Our Telekom's subsidiary received its license to operate M-SELEN as a regulated mobile money service.

### SOLATS: The Infrastructure Upgrade

In April 2024, CBSI launched **SOLATS (Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System)**—a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system developed with IFC/World Bank technical assistance and Australian/New Zealand funding.

SOLATS replaces manual cheque clearing that previously required 2-3 day settlement. Interbank transfers now process in approximately **10 minutes**. A linked Central Securities Depository enables electronic registry for government securities.

This creates the backbone for:
- Lower-cost digital payments
- Faster settlement
- Eventual interoperability between mobile money and bank accounts
- Regional payment network integration

### The Regulatory Sandbox

CBSI's Regulatory Sandbox (launched April 2022) provides a controlled testing environment for fintech innovations. Notable sandbox participants:

- **IumiCash**: Tested e-wallet solution before receiving full Money Transfer Operator license
- **MobileFund**: SINPF's digital nano-loan product tested in 2023-24
- **ACCountplan**: First successful sandbox applicant (August 2023), testing cross-regional remittance application

### Cryptocurrency Stance: Cautious

CBSI has issued clear warnings that cryptocurrencies **"do not have any legal tender status"** and **"strongly discourages the public to invest"** due to speculative risks. No regulatory framework governs crypto trading, taxation, or service providers—it exists in a legal gray area (not prohibited but not regulated).

However, the IMF's 2024 report suggests **foreign currency-backed stablecoins could be realistic alternatives** for Pacific nations, "though only with robust regulation and supervision."

## Bokolo Cash: The CBDC Experiment

### Central Bank Digital Currency Pilot

In November 2023, Solomon Islands launched **Bokolo Cash**—a Central Bank Digital Currency proof-of-concept. The name references traditional shell money (*bokolo*) historically used in parts of the Solomons.

**Technical Details:**
- Built on **Hyperledger Iroha 2** permissioned blockchain
- Developed in partnership with Japanese fintech **Soramitsu** (the company behind Cambodia's Bakong CBDC)
- Funded by the Japanese government
- Each Bokolo equals **SBD 1** and functions as legal tender within the pilot

**Testing Scope:**
- Retail transactions at selected Honiara merchants
- Wholesale interbank transfers
- Simulated cross-border payments via the SORA public blockchain
- Two-tier KYC verification system

Prime Minister Sogavare positioned the initiative as advancing "inclusive and sustainable development" and reducing financial exclusion for the underserved and unbanked.

The CBSI (Amendment) Act 2023 provides legislative foundation for digital currency developments—suggesting Solomon Islands is seriously exploring a path from pilot to implementation.

## Telecom Market Entry: Strategic Considerations

### The M-Pesa Playbook in Pacific Context

International experience from similar markets reveals success factors:

**M-Pesa (Kenya)**: The canonical success story grew financial inclusion from 26% (2006) to 84% (2021) with 30.2 million active users. Critical factors:
- Safaricom's 77% market share at launch providing distribution advantage
- Agent network of **81,025 outlets** forming the operational backbone
- Simple "send money home" value proposition on basic handsets via SIM toolkit
- Transparent pricing undercutting bank fees
- Regulatory flexibility via "test-and-learn" approach

**Fiji (M-PAiSA)**: Demonstrates Pacific success—632,123 users representing over two-thirds of the population, 316% year-over-year growth in P2P transactions, FJ$83.6 million in e-money circulation. Phase 3 of Fiji's National Payment System enables direct bank-to-mobile wallet transfers.

**Papua New Guinea (CellMoni)**: Digicel's service reached 1.6 million individual users. **EasiPawa**—prepaid electricity via airtime—"blitzed all usage forecasts," demonstrating the power of utility integration. However, agent liquidity problems in rural areas undermined trust.

### Key Success Factors for Solomon Islands

1. **Agent network density is the critical bottleneck**, not technology sophistication. M-SELEN's 3,000+ agents represent significant progress but remain thin for 740,000 people across 900+ islands.

2. **USSD-first service design** ensuring feature phone compatibility. With 50% of mobile users on 2G and only 42% smartphone penetration among mobile users, app-only services fail.

3. **Anchor in high-volume, guaranteed institutional payments**: International remittances (SBD 431 million), utility collections, and potentially Government-to-Person payments create sustainable revenue.

4. **Bank partnership model** recommended given regulatory uncertainty. Operate as licensed agent or technical provider to existing commercial bank while CBSI finalizes non-bank PSP framework.

5. **Proactive CBSI engagement**: The Central Bank is actively seeking partners who contribute to NFIS3 targets—1,155 access points by 2025 creates clear collaboration pathway.

### Infrastructure Constraints

Any payment service design must account for:

- **Electricity**: Only **16% of households** have grid connections. Feature phones with long battery life dominate rural usage.
- **Connectivity**: Single submarine fiber optic cable connects only 4 of ~300 inhabited islands; rest depend on satellite or microwave. May 2023 anchor drop caused major outages.
- **Identification**: Only **30% of the population has birth certificates**. No national ID system. SIM card registration being mandated to build digital identity database.

## The Opportunity Matrix

### Payment Use Cases by Strategic Priority

| Use Case | Current State | Friction/Cost | Telecom Opportunity |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| International Remittances | Record SBD 431M (2024) | Average cost: 11.1% | Low-cost mobile-to-wallet service; capture PALM scheme flows |
| Domestic Remittances | 72% done in physical cash | High security risk, lack of traceability | P2P mobile transfer; drives agent volume |
| Utility Payments (Cashpower) | Mobile top-up established | Limited integration across providers | Seamless 24/7 mobile wallet integration |
| Merchant Payments | 73.3% rural excluded from digital commerce | Lack of payment/logistics infrastructure | QR/USSD merchant solutions |

### Regional Integration Opportunities

- **Pacific Payments Mechanism (PPM)**: Feasibility study underway under Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. Regional payment aggregation platform to reduce costs and strengthen cross-border connectivity.
- **Cross-border mobile money links**: Fiji-Cook Islands (April 2024), Fiji-Vanuatu (2023) demonstrate Pacific mobile money networks forming. Solomon Islands could eventually join.
- **Comprehensive Credit Reporting Regulations 2025**: Solomon Islands becomes first Pacific nation with positive credit reporting regime—expanding data sources to utility records and voter files, potentially enabling credit scoring for previously unbanked.

## Conclusion: The Last Mile as First Priority

The Solomon Islands financial ecosystem sits at an inflection point. The foundational elements—policy support, improving infrastructure, and demonstrated demand—are in place for a digital payments transformation. M-SELEN's rapid growth validates the market; the question is whether that momentum can extend to the last mile.

For a telecom market entrant, the strategic priorities are clear:

1. **Agent network investment** represents the primary competitive battleground—3,000+ agents must be matched or exceeded, with particular focus on rural/outer island presence.

2. **Remittance corridor capture** through direct integration with Australian and New Zealand sending services could differentiate a new entrant, given 8,700+ seasonal workers remitting through high-cost channels.

3. **Utility payment integration** with Solomon Power's prepaid meters creates recurring transaction volume and daily use cases.

4. **CBDC positioning** through early engagement with CBSI on Bokolo Cash integration could establish competitive advantage as the pilot expands.

The fundamental market reality: **75% of Solomon Islanders lack bank accounts, but 70% have mobile phones**. Closing that gap—island by island, agent by agent, transaction by transaction—defines both the opportunity and the challenge.
