  "text": " Welcome to the Deep Dive, the show where we break down complex research into, well, into actionable insights. Helping you get up to speed on difficult markets and fast. Today we're doing an exercise in what you might call exploratory due diligence. We're leaning really heavily on some fantastic work from UDAM research. That's why you D-A-M-E. Right, pronounced you do may. And the focus today is very specific, very practical. We're looking at the Solomon Islands. Specifically, it's financial and payment infrastructure. The idea is if you were thinking about entering that market, say, as a new telecom or internet provider, what would you actually be facing? Exactly. How do people pay for things? What are the real barriers on the ground? And maybe most importantly, where are the gaps in the current system? Because that's where the opportunity is. And the first thing that jumps out from the UDAM reports is this. This real contradiction. Almost a paradox at the heart of the country's financial landscape. A paradox is a good way to put it. Let's start with the absolute baseline. How do people transact day to day? It's all cash. I mean, the economy is just, it's overwhelmingly dominated by physical currency. Their reports are clear that about 80% of all transactions are still done in cash. 80%. So you're dealing with a true cash-first cash-dominant society. Right. And that fact alone tells you there's a huge bottleneck in the system. So it's no surprise then if 80% of transactions are cash, that formal banking access is pretty low. It's incredibly low, severely restricted. We're looking at numbers around only 25% of the entire population having a bank account. Just one in four. Yeah. So you have three quarters of the country completely outside of that formal banking system. But they're still buying and selling things every single day. Okay, so that's one side of the paradox. High commercial activity, but very, very low formal financial inclusion. Exactly. But here's the twist. And this is really the whole reason a telecom operator would even be looking at the space. While banking access is terrible, digital reach is surprisingly high. That's the key metric. That's the number to focus on. Despite all the physical infrastructure challenges, 70% of the population has a mobile phone. 70%. Think about that gap for a second. 75% of people don't have a bank account. But 70% of them are carrying the one device you need for digital finance. So the traditional delivery mechanism, the bank branch on the corner, that's failed. Completely failed to scale. But the digital delivery mechanism, the mobile network, it's already there. It's substantially built out. And that gap, that 75% unbanked versus the 70% with a mobile, that is, I mean, that's the textbook definition of an opportunity for a telco-led financial service. The network can just bypass the physical limitations that stop the banks. It can. And we don't even have to guess if there's demand for it. The research points to a service called Mcellin, which launched in 2023. And it basically proves the case overnight. It's an immediate validation of all that latent demand. The numbers are genuinely notable. This wasn't the slow gradual thing. This was an explosion of adoption. So tell us about the scale of Mcellin's launch. Okay, so Mcellin is run by our telecom, which is the big incumbent telecom provider there. They started with about 20,000 users in June of 2023. Right. By early 2025, so less than two years later, they'd grown to 350,000 users. 350,000. And they'd set up over 3,000 agents. So what does that mean in terms of population share? It means roughly half the entire population signed up for a formal digital financial service in under two years. Half the country. Yeah. That's not just growth. That proves there was this massive pent-up need. People were just waiting for an alternative. The friction in the old system was so high that as soon as a workable mobile alternative appear, they jumped at it. So for our potential market entrant, what does that prove? It proves two things. One, the demand is absolutely real. You don't have to wonder about that. But two, the competition is already there and they're very well established. So the question now isn't if digital finance can work. No. The question is how a new player could possibly compete in the market that M. Cillin has already built. It's clear that geography is the villain of the story for traditional banking. Let's dig into that for our second section. Let's really understand the status quo, the physical reality of the Solomon Islands. You have to. I mean, geography isn't just a small factor here. It's the central defining constraint on everything related to financial access. We're talking about an archipelago. A huge one. It's nearly a thousand islands. And they're spread out across 1,500 kilometers of ocean. A thousand islands. The dispersion is just. It's immense. So moving anything, people, goods, and especially cash is a massive logistical challenge. It's difficult and it's expensive. And I imagine the population is in all clustered in one place. Not at all. That's the other part of the problem. 76% of the population lives in rural areas. They're scattered across all these islands. So a business model that relies on physical locations like a bank branch. It's just not economically viable. You can't build and staff branches across that kind of geography to serve a dispersed rural population. So what does that mean for the average person living in a rural area? What's the real cost, the friction for them to just access their money? The numbers on this are, well, they're pretty so bring. The average cost for a one-way trip to get to any kind of financial access point. And that could be a bank and ATM. Even a mobile money agent. Any of them. The average cost is $8.67 US. One way. One way. In an economy where daily incomes can be quite low, that's a huge barrier. It's a prohibitive amount of money just to make one transaction. And what about the time it takes? The time commitment is just as big a deal. The average travel time to reach an access point in a rural area is nearly 70 minutes. 70 minutes. One way. Again, one way. And you have to picture how they're making this journey. For 30% of customers, this involves a boat or canoe. This isn't like hopping on a bus for a few minutes. It's a long multi-stage and sometimes risky trip just to get cash or pay a bill. So you're talking about what? Over two hours of your day, plus the cost of the trip, just for one financial interaction. Exactly. It's not just friction. It's a systemic barrier that basically locks people out of the formal economy. It makes holding cash at home the only logical choice. And this friction obviously dictates where the few banks that do exist decide to put their resources. Of course. The banking infrastructure is extremely concentrated. First of all, there are only four commercial banks in the entire country. Four banks for a thousand islands. You've got BSP. That's Bank of South Pacific, ANZ, Bread Bank, and Panoshannic Bank. That's it. And their physical footprint must be tiny. It is. The entire nation has just 15 bank branches. 15. And the centralization is extreme. Over 70% of them are in Hanuyara, the capital. So for the vast majority of the country, there's just no branch to go to. Not at all. And I'm guessing it's the same story for things like ATMs. It's actually worse. The country has 59 ATMs in total. But 83% of those are also in Hanuyara. And what about EFTPOS terminals? The card machines in chops. Same pattern. 423 terminals nationwide, and 72% of them are in the capital. So this whole system, it's not built for the country. It's built for one city. It's designed to serve the concentrated urban population and, you know, salaried government workers. It's not for the rural majority. What does that mean for how even the bank population uses their accounts? It means the bank isn't really a hub for transactions. It's a secure box to get cash from. The data shows that over 90% of all card transactions happen at ATMs. Not at a point of sale. No, almost entirely for cash withdrawals. So even for the lucky 25% who are banked, their main interaction is just taking cash out. The system outside Hanuyara is for all practical purposes absent. Which brings us back to the scale of exclusion. So we have 25% banked. What about the other 75%? How do they manage their financial lives? The research breaks that group down. First, you have about 35% of the population who rely on informal systems. So things like money lenders, savings clubs? Exactly. Rotating savings, and credit associations, community-based systems, they provide a certain level of social safety net, but they don't have scale and they lack security. And then there's a second group, which is even more worrying. Yes. A full 31% of the population is described as completely excluded. Meaning no formal or even informal services. None whatsoever. That's nearly a third of the nation just operating entirely on cash outside any system at all. That creates a huge amount of economic vulnerability. The research also flagged a gender gap, which is important for any new entrant to consider. It did. The data shows that women face a 12% gap in account ownership compared to men. So any new mobile money service that wants to achieve real inclusion needs to think about that from day one. Product design, agent training, marketing, it all has to account for that gap. Okay, so the problem is clearly geography. And the traditional solution of physical banks has completely failed to meet the challenge. Right. So let's move into our third section, the digital disruption. Oh. How did M.Cellan succeed where the banks couldn't? Well, M.Cellan, which is peogen for mobile money, had one massive, overwhelming strategic advantage. They were run by the main telecom company. Our telecom, they already had the customers. They held somewhere between 60 and 80% of the mobile market share. So they weren't starting from scratch. They were basically just activating their existing user base. And as we said, their growth was huge. 350,000 users, 3,000 agents in under two years. But the real key to that success, the thing a new entrant absolutely has to understand, was their technology choice. This is the critical point. They chose accessibility above all else. M.Cellan runs on USS D code. Unstructured supplementary service data. So that's the the menu you get when you dial a number like star one to three hash. Exactly. And the reason that's so important is that it works on any phone. You don't need a smartphone, you don't need an app, you don't need a data connection. And that's non-negotiable for achieving mass scale in the Solomon Islands. It is because the infrastructure on the ground dictates it. Only about a quarter of the population actually has 4G coverage. And the main fiber optic cable only connects a few of the main islands. Right. And a full 50% of mobile users are still on the older 2G GSM networks. So if you come in with a fancy app only service, you've immediately written off half your potential market. The half that uses those basic long battery life feature phones. M.Cellan shows the tech that works everywhere for everyone reliably. And they offered the full suite of basic services, cash in, cash out, peer-to-peer transfers, bill pay, remittances. But it feels like the digital site is only half the story. Their success is really built on a physical network. It absolutely is. The digital wallet is useless if you can't get cash into it or out of it. M.Cellan's rapid growth is fundamentally a story about building that physical last mile. And that's the agent network. The 3000 plus agents. They started with only 250. That network is the essential CICO infrastructure cash in, cash out. And these are usually local shopkeepers, people the community already knows and trusts. For a new company trying to enter this market, what's the biggest challenge in building out an agent network like that? Is it just finding the people? Finding them is part of it. But the real operational nightmare is liquidity management. Making sure the agents have enough cash. Exactly. You have to make sure those 3000 agents spread across all those islands always have enough physical cash on hand for when people want to withdraw. If an agent runs dry, it breaks the trust in the entire system. And you also have to make sure they can securely deposit the cash they take in. It's a massive logistics operation. The competitive battle here isn't one by having a better app. It's one by having the most reliable agent network with the best liquidity management. Emcellen is clearly the dominant player, but they aren't the only one. What does the rest of the competitive landscape look like? Well, the first one to mention is Ezepay. They actually launched earlier back in February 2020. And they're run by Solomon Post, the postal service. Right. And they have a really interesting piece of tech. They use something called sim-skin technology. It's basically a thin electronic sticker you put on your SIM card. What does that do? It lets their service work across any mobile network. So you don't have to be an R Telecom customer to use it. That's a huge advantage in theory. And they were also an early mover on a really important use case. Yes. They got authorized early on to handle payments for pre-paid electricity, which is called cash power. But their big weaknesses scale. They only have about 50 agents. 50 versus Emcellen's 3000. It's just a different league. Okay. Who else is there? Then you have Yumi Cash. They launched in early 2021 with a totally different strategy. How so? They're QR code-based and smartphone only. So they're not going for mass market. They're targeting the younger, more tech-savvy urban population. But they did get an important regulatory win. They did. In 2023, the Central Bank, the CBSI, gave them a money transfer operator license. An MTO license. Which is a big deal because it shows the regulator is willing to license these non-bank fintechs to handle international money flows. And what about the actual banks? Are they doing anything in the mobile space? They are, but it's mostly further existing customers. BSP, for example, has a USSD mobile banking service. But you have to already have a BSP bank account to use it. So it's not a tool for financial inclusion. It's a convenience feature for the already banked. Exactly. It doesn't solve the core problem of reaching the unbanked majority. And the numbers from before M. Sellon's big growth spurt really tell that story. They do. In July 2023, before M. Sellon really took off, there were only about 13,000 mobile wallet accounts in the whole country across all platforms. And only 10 to 15% of them are even active. So the earlier attempts just didn't get traction? No. It was M. Sellon with its huge telecom user base and its USSD first strategy that really cracked the code and changed the whole landscape. Okay, let's talk about the business case. A new service can't just survive on people sending small amounts of money to each other. You need big, consistent high volume flows. You need commercial anchors. Which brings us to section four, high volume use cases. And let's start with the biggest one. Remittances. This is, I think, the single most important commercial opportunity in the entire market. International remittances aren't just a side show. They are a pillar of the national economy now. What kind of numbers are we talking about? The volume hit a record high in 2024. Somewhere between 431 and 475 million Solomon Islands dollars. Which is about $55 to $89 million US dollars. Right. And the growth is what's really key. That number was up 68% year over year. 68%. It's huge. Remittances are now the third largest source of foreign exchange for the country. Wow. After what? Logging in Coco. Exactly. It's that significant. So what's driving this massive flood of money into the country? It's all about labor mobility programs. The Solomon Islands sends thousands of seasonal workers to Australia and New Zealand. Right. I've heard about these schemes. There are over 7,600 workers just in Australia's Palombe scheme and over 1,000 in New Zealand. So you've got close to 9,000 workers abroad sending money home every month. And that number is set to grow. The government's target is 16,000 workers abroad by 2028. So this remittance pipeline is structurally guaranteed to get bigger and bigger. So huge opportunity. But the current system for sending that money is, well, it sounds pretty broken based on the fees. It is. The cost of sending money to the Solomon Islands is incredibly high. The average fee is around 11.1% of the amount sent. 11%. It's four times the global average. It's nowhere near the UN sustainable development goal of 3%. Why is it so expensive? Is it just a lack of competition? It's a mix of things. Limited competition is definitely part of it. A player like Western Union can maintain high prices in that cash to cash quarter. But the bigger issue is the operational cost of that last mile. Right. The money arrives digitally in Honeara, but then it has to become physical cash and get out to the islands. And that involves planes, boats, security. That whole logistical nightmare gets priced into the fee the consumer pays. So the obvious strategy for a new digital player is to slash that fee by keeping it digital all the way to the recipient's phone. That's the play. You see digital MTOs, money transfer operators like ClickX and Rhea money transfer, starting to integrate directly with mobile wallets like M-Sellon. So the money goes from a bank account in Australia straight into the M-Sellon wallet on an island in the Solomon's? Exactly. You cut out the entire physical cash handling process in the middle. That lets you offer a much lower fee and grab market share. That's the international piece. But the report also mentioned a lot of friction inside the country with domestic remittances. Yeah. This is a huge, often overlooked opportunity. 72% of money is sent within the Solomon Islands. Say, from a worker in Honeara to their family in a rural province is sent as physical cash. Curied on a boat or a bus? Yes. It's insecure. It's slow. It's untraceable. A reliable, instant, pure-to-peer, mobile transfer service solves that problem completely. It's a massive improvement in security and convenience. Okay, so remittances are the big revenue driver. What's the other key use case for stickiness and retention? Utility payments. You have to be able to pay your essential bills. Starting with electricity, Solomon Power. Solomon Power is a key partner for any mobile money service. A lot of their customers use a prepaid system called cash power. So you top up your meter like you top up your phone with airtime? Exactly. The user behavior is identical. It's a natural fit for mobile payments. Both as a pay and M-cell in let you buy your electricity token right from your phone. No more 70-minute boat trip just to keep the lights on. But we should be clear about the scale here. Electricity access itself is still quite low. Very low. Only about 14 to 16 percent of the population has access to the grid. That number is growing, so the customer base is expanding, but it's still a relatively small slice of the population for now. What about the other big utility? Solomon Water. Solomon Water is the other key institutional partner. They have both post-paid billing and a prepaid system called cash water. And in October 2023, they partnered directly with our telecom. So all their customers can now pay their water bills through M-cell in. There's 17,000 customer connections, yes. These kinds of partnerships are critical. They embed the mobile wallet into the core financial life of a household. There's one more example in the research that's really important. Not for its scale, but for what it proved was possible. You save low-mobile. Yes, this is a crucial precedent for any new entrant to understand. It was launched back in 2017 by the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, their pension fund. And it lets people save for retirement using their phone. Using airtime. It's an amazing system. It lets users convert mobile airtime top-ups, anything from $10,000 to $1,000 directly into their formal pension savings account, all through a simple USSD menu. So what does that precedent prove to a new company looking at this market? It proves two fundamental things. First, the regulators, including the central bank, are completely comfortable with using the Telecom network as the rails for serious formal financial products like pensions. It's not just for small payments. No. And second, it proves that the public understands and trusts the USSD interface for these kinds of important transactions. It's the blueprint that shows both regulatory and consumer acceptance is already there. Okay, so we have the geography, the tech, the business case. Now for the really crucial part for any market entry plan. Section five, the regulatory backbone and the new infrastructure. Who makes the rules and what are the new systems in play? The main player is the central bank of Solomon Islands, the CBSI. And they are not a passive regulator. They are actively driving the agenda. Through their national financial inclusion strategy. Right. They're on their third iteration now, NFIS3, which runs from 2021 to 2025. And they set very specific targets. Which is helpful for a new company because it tells you what the government wants to see. It gives you a roadmap. The CBSI's target is to have 400,000 active financial accounts and 1,155 total access points in the country by 2025. So if you're a telecom planning to roll out say, 3,000 agents. You're directly helping the government hit its national strategic goal for access points. Aligning your business plan with those national goals is the smartest thing you can do to smooth your regulatory path. And the whole sector is now governed by a new piece of legislation. Yes, the National Payment Systems Act of 2022. This was a landmark law. It created the legal framework for licensing non-bank payment service providers or PSPs. Which is what EMSLAN is. Exactly. The Act gives the CBSI the power to set standards, regulate operations, and crucially enforce consumer protection. The CBSI also set up a way for new ideas to be tested safely. The regulatory sandbox. The sandbox is their test environment launched in April 2022. It lets fintechs like a UmiCache trial new products without needing the full heavy compliance burden right away. It's a low-risk way to innovate. So a new market entrant could potentially use the sandbox to test a new remittance product or something similar. Precisely. It's the designated channel for that kind of experimentation. Beyond the laws, the CBSI has also been upgrading the core infrastructure, the actual plumbing of the financial system. Let's talk about Solots. Solots is a huge deal. It stands for the Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System. It launched in April 2024 and it is a modern real-time gross settlement system or RTGS. Okay, what does that mean in simple terms? It means that the big high-value payments between the banks themselves, like a transfer from BSP to ANZ, now happen almost instantly. They settle in minutes, not days. And this replaced an old manual system. A very slow manual check-based clearing process. This was a massive upgrade, it did a lot of help from the World Bank, Australia, and New Zealand. What's the practical impact of having an RTGS system for a mobile money operator? It's absolutely critical for managing that liquidity we talked about. Your 3000 agents need to be able to move money between their own bank accounts and the companies accounts instantly to rebalance their cash floats. Solots makes that fast, scalable, and secure. It's the backbone you need for a modern digital payment system to work properly. Now let's touch on the most forward-looking piece of the CBSI's work. The central bank digital currency experiment, Bokalokash. We have to be really clear here, this is a proof of concept, a posse. It's a pilot, not a live nationwide currency. But it's still a very significant signal of their intent. Emensely significant. It's named Bokalokash after the traditional shell money. It launched in November 2023. And what's the tech behind it? It's built on a permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Iroha too. And they're working with a company called Sora Mitsu, the same firm that helped build Cambodia's digital currency they call. And inside the pilot, each Bokalok unit is equal to one Solomon Islands dollar. Yes, it's pegged one-to-one and considered legal tender within the pilot. They're testing it for specific things. Retail payments in Honeara, wholesale transfers between institutions, and even simulated cross-border payments. And they already passed a lot to give them the authority to do this. The CBSI Amendment Act of 2023, they laid the legal groundwork first. So the central bank is clearly all in on exploring a sovereign digital currency. What's their view on private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A very hard line. They've put out clear warnings saying that things like Bitcoin do not have any legal tender status, and they strongly discourage the public to invest. So they see a clear difference between their controlled sovereign CBDC and the unregulated crypto world. A huge firewall between the two. Their focus is on controlled regulated sovereign digital finance. Okay, let's pull all of this together. Section 6. The practical implications and barriers for our hypothetical new telecom operator. What are the big unavoidable headaches they're going to face? Well, you have to start with the hard infrastructure realities. First, connectivity. There's only one submarine fiber optic cable and it only lands on four islands. So everyone else is on less reliable connections? Microwave or satellite links. And we have to say it again. 50% of the population is still on 2DGSM networks. And the risk there isn't just about slow speeds. It's about stability. Right. The research mentions things like an anchor being dropped on the cable in May 2023, causing major outages. So your service has to be designed for resilience and for working with intermittent connections. Which brings us back to U.S. It always comes back to U.S. The second big constraint is electricity. Only 14 to 16% of households are connected to the grid. Your service has to work on a feature phone that can hold a charge for days. And the third major barrier, when the effects compliance is identification. This is a huge structural problem. Only 30% of the population even has a birth certificate. There's no national ID card system. So how do you do KYC? How do you know your customer? It's very difficult. The government is pushing mandatory SIM card registration as a way to start building a foundational ID database. But any new financial service has to work with the CBSI to develop alternative approved ways of identifying customers for account opening. Given all those challenges, we land back on what you said is the single most important factor. The agent network imperative. This is where the battle is won or lost. You can look at M. Paces launch in Kenya 15 years ago. Or what's happened in Papua New Guinea next door. It's always the same story. Agent density and liquidity management. They are the critical bottlenecks. MCELEN has set the benchmark at over 3000 agents. A new entrant doesn't just have to match that number. They have to build a better logistics system for managing cash flow to keep those agents liquid, especially in the most remote areas. So what's the smartest strategic path for a new player to enter this market? Well, given the new regulatory framework, especially the PSP license and the 5 million SBD minimum capital requirement. That's about $600,000 US dollars. Given that, the strong recommendation is to start with a bank partnership model. Instead going for your own license right away. Yes. Partner with one of the existing commercial banks. You can leverage their compliance framework, their existing integration into the Solet system, and their deposit base. It avoids the big upfront capital cost and the long timeline of getting your own license. And in terms of where to focus for revenue. Go after the institutional flows. You have to prioritize capturing a slice of that $431 million international remittance market. The only way to do that is to come in with a price that is significantly lower than the current 11% average fee. And at the same time, you need to drive daily use. So you need deep integration with Solomon Power and Solomon water. Paying for cash power and cash water has to be seamless. That creates the weekly sticky behavior that keeps the wallet active. And finally, a new entrant needs to be thinking bigger than just the Solomon Islands. They need to have a regional view. There's already a feasibility study underway for something called the Pacific Payments Mechanism, a regional payment platform. And you're seeing more cross-border mobile money links like between Fiji and Venowatu. So any new system you build today has to be designed for tomorrow's regional interoperability. If you want to stay competitive and scalable in the broader Pacific market, absolutely. This has been a really comprehensive look at the financial infrastructure of the Solomon Islands. So to sum up the critical points for our potential market entrant. The market is defined by two things. The high friction of geography and a deep reliance on cash. But Amazon success has proven that there is massive overwhelming demand for a digital alternative as long as it's delivered through the telecom network that people already have and trust. That's right. And the competitive fight is not really about technology. It's about operations. It's going to be one or lost on the ground based on the strength and reliability of that agent network, those thousands of physical cash points. And it's about anchoring the business in those big institutional flows, like remittances and utility payments. And doing it all with a USSD first design that works for everyone while engaging strategically with the CBSI and keeping an eye on where they're headed with things like the Bokalokash pilot. You know, what's really fascinating about this whole story is that this modern digital success is built on two very old traditional foundations of trust. What do you mean? The telecom network, which people have used and trusted for years to communicate. And the local shopkeeper, the human agent who is a known and trusted face in the community. That is the essential takeaway. You're absolutely right. The question for a new operator isn't if the financial system there is going to digitize. That's a given. It's already happening. The real question is, the real question is, who can build the operational machine and the human trust needed to move money reliably from the 70% of people who have phones to the 75% who don't have bank accounts? Not just in the capital, but island by island, agent by agent and doing it every single day. That's the challenge that we'll define the future of finance there.
