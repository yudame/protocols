  "text": " Welcome back to The Deep Dive, powered by UDAME Research. Today we're looking at a stack of research that tells a, well, a truly extraordinary story of financial transformation. It's happening right now in the South Pacific. We're talking about the Solomon Islands. It's a place that most people probably don't associate with cutting-edge finance. Exactly. When we talk about global fintech innovation, the conversation, it almost always centers on places like Silicon Valley, right? Or maybe you think of emerging markets, like India, with their massive digital stacks. Sure, the Indie Stack, UPI, all of that. But the Solomon Islands, I mean, we're talking about a sprawling, geographically fragmented nation. It's quietly become one of the most compelling case studies in what the experts call leapfrogging. A classic leapfrog event. And it's happening at a speed that is, frankly, hard to believe. So here's the paradox we're really going to dive into today. Yeah. How does a country where get this 80% of all transactions still rely on physical cash? Still today. And which has only 15 official bank branches spread across the nation of nearly 1,000 islands. How does a country like that manage to pull off this rapid, massive mobile money revolution? And not just mobile money. They're even piloting a central bank digital currency. It just seems to defy financial gravity. It absolutely does, but that's the key. That geographic friction, the very thing that made traditional finance impossible, that's precisely the catalyst for this innovation. So the problem created the solution. Exactly. Traditional finance failed there because the cost of infrastructure was just too high. I mean, think about it. Building bank branches, moving physical cash by boat to hundreds of different islands. It's a non-starter. It was simply too expensive to justify serving the 76% of the population that lives in rural areas. So our mission today is to really thoroughly untack this specific leapfrog phenomenon. We want to understand the mechanisms of its stunning success. And we'll get into the numbers, you know, the journey from 20,000 to 350,000 users in under two years. And most importantly, we want to extract the crucial actionable principles for any fintech, for any telecom company that's looking to navigate market entry in these kinds of challenging low connectivity, remote environments, anywhere in the world. And the size of that opportunity, I think, is defined by this one single stunning juxtaposition that I found in the research. It really stopped me in my tracks. I think I know the one you're talking about. As of today, only about 25% of the entire population has a formal bank account. Right. Massive financial exclusion, three out of four people are unbanked. But here's the crucial counterpoint. Roughly 70% of the population already has a mobile phone. And there it is. That 45% differential. That gap between having a mobile device in your pocket and having a formal financial service, that's the market. That's the entire game right there. It's the latent demand just waiting to be activated. If you can serve that existing mobile user base, you can nearly triple the rate of financial inclusion almost overnight. OK, let's unpack this then. I think we need to start by defining the scale of the original problem. We have to really understand the true structural limitations that made cash dominance not just a preference, but an absolute necessity for daily life. It is the only option. So we've established 80% of all transactions are cash. But let's go deeper on what that really means for the financial health of the population. What do the statistics tell us about inclusion before this mobile money revolution really took off? The statistics, I mean, they paint a very, very clear picture of structural exclusion. We have the 80% cash number, the 25% bank account number. But when we look broader at access to any formal financial services. So that includes things like insurance, formal credit? Exactly. Anything official, only 34% of the population engages with them at all. This is the official economy failing to reach two thirds of its own people. So I have to ask, where does the remaining two thirds, that 66%, where did they put their money? Were we talking about just keeping it under a mattress? It's a mix. The population is really divided. The research shows that about 35% of Solomon Islanders rely heavily on these informal mechanisms. What does it look like? This includes traditional community savings clubs, which are known locally as talk story groups. It also means relying on unregulated money lenders, which carries a lot of risk. So there's a community support element, but it's not secure. Exactly. These mechanisms offer peer support, but they lack formal security. They lack any potential for growth, like earning interest. And critically, this is the really stark number. 31% of the population is completely excluded from any financial services, formal or informal. Completely off the grid. Completely. And it's also really important to acknowledge the social cost here, because this exclusion, it isn't gender neutral. That's so. Well, the data shows that women face a persistent 12% gender gap in formal account ownership when compared to men. This lack of access, it directly limits their ability to start a business, to achieve economic stability for their families. It's a major drag on development. So it's very clear the demand for financial services is there. Yeah. But the traditional system, it just couldn't meet it. It wasn't a cultural problem of people not wanting banks. Not at all. It was an extreme, logistical one. And I think we have to talk about the geography now, because that is the fundamental structural barrier that explains everything else. The geography is unforgiving. I don't think that's too strong a word. We are talking about an archipelago. It spans nearly 1,000 islands scattered over 1,500 kilometers of the Pacific Ocean. It's hard to even conceptualize that scale. Try to imagine servicing a country where 76% of the population lives in rural areas and not just outside the main city, but often on entirely different, very difficult to reach islands. And the traditional banking infrastructure that does exist, it's heavily concentrated, which means the risk it's also concentrated. How centralized is access to those few physical branches in ATMs? It is severely, I would argue, fatally centralized. Across this vast ocean expanse, there are only 15 commercial bank branches in total. And of those 15, over 70% of them are crammed into Honiara, the capital city on the island of Guadalcanal. And I'm guessing it's the same story for ATMs. The situation is identical for hardware access. There are just 59 automated teller machines or ATMs nationwide. And 83% of those are also concentrated solely in Honiara. So if you live in say, Hwesewal province, or the remote parts of Malayda, access is effectively a multi-day journey. It's not a trip to the bank. It's an expedition. It is. And this is where the research provided some genuinely shocking data points that quantify the human cost of this exclusion. Let's hear them. This is where that geographic friction becomes economically quantified. The research found that for an average rural customer, the average one-way cost to travel just to reach a financial access point. So a bank or an ATM is $8.67 US. $8.67, one-way. One-way. Now, when you consider that the average household income is quite low, $8.67 is a massive, often prohibitive cost, just to perform a basic transaction like a deposit. And we're not just talking about the expense. It's the logistics of the journey itself. It's not just hopping in a taxi to go downtown. Absolutely not. This is one of the most vivid details. The research found that 30% of customers must rely on boats or canoes. We're talking small, open aircraft, often unprotected from the elements, simply to reach a location where they can conduct a formal financial transaction. That's incredible. And the time cost is enormous. The average travel time just to reach a bank agent in a rural area is nearly 70 minutes, one-way. 70 minutes. So that's well over two hours round trip, often involving high-risk travel by C, just to deposit or withdraw your own money. 70 minutes by canoe, which is four times the average travel time in neighboring Fiji. And you're paying almost $9 for the privilege. That just puts the entire concept of financial inclusion into a completely different perspective. It does. And this friction, it explains a secondary, really fascinating insight from the research. Because cash is so essential, and because accessing the bank is so costly and time-consuming, even the people who are banked. The 25%. Yes, even they don't use their accounts for digital payments. They use them purely as storage vaults, as cash to spendceries. So you treat the bank as a place to cash your paycheck or store your funds until you can afford the time and the travel cost to go and withdraw a large amount of cash to live on for the next month. Precisely. And the data confirming this is very, very clear. Over 90% of all car transactions across the entire country, the current ATMs for cash withdrawal. Not a grocery stores, not paying for goods. No, they're not being used at merchant terminals for point of sale purchases. The entire banking system was, by necessity, a cash management utility. It wasn't a modern payment network. The market was not just broken. It was ripe for a non-traditional player to step in and entirely sidestepped the cost of all that physical infrastructure. So we have the perfect setup. Massive latent demand, a system completely crippled by distance and cost and population that already holds the primary piece of necessary hardware. The mobile phone. That sets the stage perfectly for the mobile money explosion, which is centered around a service called M.Cellan. M.Cellan. And the name is fantastic because it means mobile money in the local Pajan language, where Cellan translates directly to money. I love that. It's immediately understandable. It is. And this was the defining watershed moment. It launched in June of 2023, operated by a company called Our Telecom. Now, our telecom is not just any telco. They are the incumbent, the dominant provider. They command a massive 60% to 80% share of the entire mobile market. That market share is the foundation of their success, isn't it? I mean, they didn't need to go out and acquire users. They already had a direct relationship with them. That existing relationship and crucially, the existing infrastructure, the tower network, the retail air time distribution system, it gave them an insurmountable head start. But the growth trajectory, that's what makes this story globally relevant. So what are the numbers? They launched with about 20,000 registered users. By early 2025, in less than two years, they had swelled that user base to 350,000 active users. OK, let me stop you there because that number is absolutely staggering. 350,000 users. In a country of roughly 740,000 people, that means in 20 months, nearly half the entire population gained access to a formal financial instrument for the first time. Half the country. That is, mpz level speed, but in what sounds like a much more difficult operating environment. It is explosive, exponential growth. And it wasn't achieved by building bank branches. It was achieved by building a revolutionary type of infrastructure, the agent network. The agent network. The research highlights this truly massive expansion. They went from just 250 agents at launch to over 3,000 agents by early 2025. So the agents then, they are the new branches. They're the liquidity hubs that finally solve the physical cash problem. Why is that face-to-face interaction and that density so crucial in this unique geographic context? It addresses two critical issues at the same time. Liquidity and trust. First, liquidity. In a cash-dominant economy, digital money is only valuable if you can reliably and easily convert it back into physical cash. The cash-in cash-out problem. Exactly. The CICO problem. The agents provide those essential cash-in and cash out points. With 3,000 of them scattered across the islands, they have drastically reduced that average 70 minute travel time we talked about. Right. Now the bank is just down the road. Exactly. And second, and this is maybe even more important, is trust. These agents are typically existing, trusted local shopkeepers. They're often selling essential goods like rice or mobile airtime. So they're known in the community. They are a known entity. A rural Solomon Islander might view a distant, unknown institution like a commercial bank with a healthy dose of suspicion. But they trust the person who sells them their phone credit every week. This localized trust built right into the agent model. It mirrors the core foundation of MPSIS success in Kenya. And it allowed MSEL into achieve that viral adoption where the banks never could. Now, this brings us to the technological design choice, which I think completely flips conventional Fintech wisdom on its head. You would expect a massive modern leapfrog solution to require 4G in a sleek smartphone app. But MSEL and went aggressively basic. This is the non-negotiable lesson for anyone looking at market entry here. USSD first design. Explain what USSD is for our listeners. It's a protocol that's been around for decades. The service operates primarily by dialing a simple code like dialing star 673 hash on your phone keypad. And that means it works on any phone, including the most basic feature phones or dumb phones that dominate rural use. So an app-only service would have failed instantly? I know. Question. Why do we have to prioritize those feature phones over smartphones? What are the hard infrastructure realities that are forcing that choice? The realities are stark. The research shows only about 25% of the population has access to 4G coverage. A full 50% of mobile users still rely on the old legacy 2G GSM networks. So for half the country, an app wouldn't even connect properly. It wouldn't. And we'll discuss this more later, but there's another factor. Only 16% of households have reliable access to electricity. If you have limited access to charging and you have slow data speeds, a feature phone with a two-week battery life and simple USSD functionality is the only reliable choice. An app requiring a power-hungry smartphone and a continuous data connection would exclude the exact population. That 45% gap we identified that the CBSI and M-Helen are trying to reach. So M-Celen, operated by the dominant telco, used the lowest common technological denominator, the USSD, and built the greatest agent density. That was the recipe for success. But they weren't the first ones to try mobile money there. Were they? No, they weren't. Can you give us a bit more detail on what the competitors were doing and why M-Celen so thoroughly dominated them? Yes, there were two notable players that came before M-Celen's boom. First, there was Ezepay, which was operated by the Solomon Post. They focused heavily on a very specific use case, prepaid electricity tokens. And they used a technology called SimSkin, which is a bit complex for the user. OK, so a niche product with a slightly clunky tech. Who else? The second was a local FinTech startup called UmiCache. They took a much more modern Silicon Valley style approach. It was QR-based, smartphone-only, and they were really targeting the urban youth market in Honeara. So they were ignoring the rural majority by design? Deliberately. And the failure of these earlier efforts to achieve any real scale is evident in the statistics from July 2023. Right before M-Celen exploded onto the scene, all the mobile wallet platforms combined had only about 13,400 accounts. And critically, only 10% to 15% of those were actually being used. So they existed, but they hadn't cracked the adoption barrier. Nobody was really using them. Exactly. Ezepay had the utility use case, but they lacked the telco scale and the agent network. EmiCache had the cool technology, but deliberately excluded the majority of the population with its smartphone-only approach. And Selen just combined the massive reach of our telatom with the necessary USB compatibility and the agent network, and it created an unstoppable combination for rapid mass inclusion. OK, so M-Celen established the infrastructure. It solved the trust and the liquidity problems with that massive agent network. But as we know from other markets, you need a compelling high-frequency reason for people to change their lifelong cash habits and actually use that digital wallet regularly. Yes, you need a killer use case. And the research points to two critical anchor use cases in the Solomon Islands, daily utilities, and high volume remittances. Let's start with utilities. Utilities are the engine of repeat engagement. They're what creates the recurring habit that's necessary for wallet stickiness. And Solomon Power, the main electricity provider, provided a perfect pre-existing model for this. You're talking about their cash power prepaid meter system. How did that model lend itself so easily to a mobile money integration? The cash power system requires customers to buy electricity tokens and then manually key those tokens into the meters in their homes. This behavior, buying a small consumable unit of something, in this case, electricity and topping up a device, is functionally identical to buying mobile airtime. Which is something 70% of the population already knows how to do. It's an existing deeply ingrained behavioral pattern. The problem before the integration was that it was a logistical hell. Customers often had to travel sometimes for hours to one of the nine official provincial Solomon power offices, wait in a long line, pay cash, and get a little paper printout with their token number. The same travel problem we saw with banking. The exact same problem. Now, thanks to the integration with platforms like Esape and especially M-cellen, customers can purchase those tokens 247 remotely right from their phone. They just enter their meter number. They pay from their mobile wallet. And the token is delivered instantly via SMS. And this isn't just about convenience for existing electricity users, is it? This is actually accelerating the pace of modernization, especially in areas that are only now getting connected to the grid. That's a critical piece of context. While only 14% to 16% of the population currently has electricity access, there are a major world bank-funded expansion projects underway. They're especially focusing on solar and microgrids in rural areas. So every new house that gets electricity is a new digital customer. Every single new connection is a new customer who is being onboarded directly into the digital payment ecosystem from day one. They are completely bypassing the need for physical cash infrastructure altogether. This is future-proofing the entire economy. And it seems Solomon Water, the water utility, quickly saw the writing on the wall and followed suit. Yes, they did. Solomon Water, which manages both cash water prepaid tokens and post-paid monthly billing, formalized its partnership with our telecom in October of 2023. This extended the convenience of M.Cellan to cover all 17,000 of their customer connections in Honeara and the provincial towns that the utility serves. Whether it's electricity or water, the basic recurring need for utilities is the critical lever that generates millions of daily transactions across the network. Before we move on to the massive revenue driver remittances, let's spend just a moment on the you-save low-mobile scheme. Because this isn't just a fascinating anecdote, it's proved that the regulator was already comfortable with using telecom infrastructure for core financial inclusion years before M.Cellan. That's right. You saved low-mobile, which was launched by the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, or SNPF, all the way back in 2017. It predates M.Cellan's boom by several years. How was it? It's a world-first micro-pension-saving scheme. It specifically targets informal workers, farmers, market vendors, people who would never step foot in a formal pension office. The genius was the mechanism. It allows mobile air-time top-ups from as little as $10 Solomon dollars to convert directly into formal pension savings. That is a phenomenal example of leveraging an existing familiar behavior topping up air time to solve a critical long-term national problem like retirement savings for the informal sector. And it solidified a crucial precedent. It demonstrated to the central bank of Solomon Islands, the CBSI, that the telco distribution rails could be secure, reliable conduits for vital formal long-term financial services. This regulatory comfort absolutely smooth the path for M.Cellan's eventual regulatory approval and its massive expansion. Okay, now let's pivot to the second anchor case. High volume, high yield international remittances. This isn't just another revenue stream. It is now a critical pillar of the national economy. It cannot be overstated. International remittances have absolutely exploded. They hit a record of somewhere between $431 and $475 million Solomon dollars. That's equivalent to about $55 to $89 million US dollars in 2024 alone. And what kind of growth does that represent? It represented a shocking 68% annual increase. It is now the third largest foreign exchange earner for the entire nation behind logging and fishing. What's driving this huge guaranteed inflow of cash from overseas? It is almost entirely driven by two very successful international labor mobility schemes. There is Australia's PLM, which is the Pacific Australia labor mobility scheme, and New Zealand's RSE, the recognized seasonal employer scheme. And how many workers are we talking about? Together, these programs employ approximately 8,700 Solomon Islanders abroad. They're working in agriculture and other seasonal industries, and they are sending a substantial portion of their earnings home to support their families. And the pipeline for this is huge too. The research notes there are over 15,000 workers currently in the work ready pool waiting for placement. This means the remittance flow is guaranteed to continue growing rapidly for the foreseeable future, providing a high volume, predictable commercial anchor for any payment system that can capture it. A guaranteed high volume. But here is the crisis point that the research highlighted. And it's truly shocking the cost crisis. How much of those seasonal workers harder into money is being eaten up by transfer fees? This is the single largest point of inefficiency in the whole system, and therefore, the biggest commercial opportunity. Sending money to the Solomon Islands costs an average of 11.1% of the total transfer amount. 11.1%. That feels criminal. That means for every $1,000 sent home by a worker who has sacrificed being away from their family for months. $111 is lost friction. It just disappears into the system. Wow. Exactly. It is roughly four times the global average transfer cost, which hoovers around 6.35%. And it's nearly four times the UN Sustainable Development Gold Target, which aims for a cost of 3% or less. Why is it so high? It's a combination of a lack of competition, the dominance of expensive old school cash to cash services, and the high compliance costs associated with moving money into what is considered a high risk jurisdiction. This 11.1% fee structure, that's the profit pool that M.Cell and its partners are actively trying to dismantle. And beyond just the cost, what were the specific friction points that made it so difficult for the recipients in remote villages to actually claim this money? The friction points were the classic symptoms of centralization we saw before. Recipients often had to travel long distances, sometimes by canoe, to Honiara, or one of the few provincial centers where traditional money transfer operators had a physical office. The same journey all over again. And identification was a massive issue. Many rural residents who lack formal government ideas or even birth certificates, they struggled to pass the Know Your Customer or KYC checks required by global firms like Western Union. Plus, there are major challenges for returning workers and accessing things like their Australian superannuation savings. So how did M.Cell and approach this? They can't just magically bypass all the international anti-money laundering regulations, but they can solve that last mile problem. That's exactly it. They focus heavily on establishing cheap, fast digital corridors. They partnered with ClickX, which is a New Zealand-based digital platform to facilitate direct mobile wallet transfers. And they did a bigger deal more recently, right? Yes, even more significantly. In 2025, they announced a major integration with Rhea money transfer that allows remittances from over 200 countries to be deposited instantly and crucially, cheaply into an M.Sallon mobile wallet. So this is the commercial breakthrough. The money completely bypasses the expensive urban centric cash pickup infrastructure. Entirely. A paul or worker in Brisbane sends the money digitally and their mother in a remote village instantly receives it in her M.Sallon wallet. It's ready to be cashed out at her local trusted agent down the street all while avoiding that catastrophic cost and time and money of a trip to Honeara. It is absolutely essential, I think, to recognize that M.Sallon success wasn't an accident. It didn't happen in a vacuum. It was enabled and actively encouraged by a highly proactive regulatory environment. So let's talk about the central bank of Salmon Islands, the CBSI, as the champion of this change. The CBSI has been the driving force behind the National Financial Inclusion Agenda for over a decade. They've led three successive national financial inclusion strategies. The current one, which is called NFIS3, and runs from 2021 to 2025, is a crucial document. It sets explicit, measurable, and you can almost say mandatory targets for the private sector. What are those key targets in NFIS3, and how do they function as an incentive for private investment from a company like our telecom? The targets basically provide a de-risked roadmap for investors, both foreign and local. NFIS3 explicitly aims to increase the number of active financial accounts to 400,000 by 2025. Which is more than half the population. Exactly. And furthermore, it mandates gender equality in this expansion. It requires that 50% of those new accounts must be held by women. And crucially, for infrastructure providers like M.C.L.N., it mandates the expansion of financial access points, the agents from a baseline of 825 to 1155 nationwide. So if you're a potential market entrant, this is significant. It's huge. It signals that the government is politically committed to inclusion. They are actively creating demand and setting infrastructure targets. So any investment that helps meet these publicly-stated goals benefits from a kind of implicit regulatory support it just reduces the political risk. Now, a functioning digital payments ecosystem it needs sophisticated, low-cost plumbing underneath it all. The CBSI also oversaw a massive upgrade of the national payment infrastructure with the introduction of something called Soulats. Let's define that for our listener. Soulats stands for the Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System. It launched in April of 2024 and it is arguably the most critical modernization step the CBSI has taken for the core financial sector in decades. Two of it is. Soulats is essentially the country's new real-time gross settlement system or RTGS. Okay, we hear the term RTGS a lot in finance. But why specifically is real-time settlement so vital for a mobile money operator that has 3,000 remote agents all relying on instantaneous liquidity to function? That is the commercial imperative right there. Previously, interbank transfers relied on manual systems and check clearing. A transfer could take two to three days for the money to actually settle. Which creates huge risk. Massive risk and liquidity headaches. Soulats, the RTGS system, cut the time for high-value interbank transfers to approximately 10 minutes. From days to minutes. Exactly. For a non-bank mobile money operator or MMO, like M-Sellon, liquidity management is everything. They have to ensure there are 3,000 remote agents always have enough physical cash on hand to meet withdrawal demands from customers. If they have to wait two or three days for funds to settle between their commercial bank partner and the central bank, their agents run dry, trust in the system collapses, and the whole thing fails. So real-time settlement is what makes the agent model viable at scale. It dramatically reduces the systemic risk and the operational cost of managing liquidity across all those dispersed islands. It makes digital payments feasible and more importantly, reliable. Okay, here's where the story gets really technologically futuristic and, frankly, surprising. The Solomon Islands is not just upgrading its existing systems. The CBSI is actively pioneering a central bank digital currency. Tell us about Bokalo Cash. Bokalo Cash. It's the name of their central bank digital currency where CBDC, proof of concept, it launched in November of 2023. And the name itself is a wonderful nod to tradition. It references the traditional shell money that was historically used for trade in the islands. So what's the technical foundation? Why did they choose this specific technology? This is a serious technical endeavor. The system is billed on the hyper ledger Iroha II platform. This is what's known as a permissioned blockchain. Beating is not open to the public like Bitcoin. Exactly. Access is strictly controlled by the central bank and other authorized participants. And they develop this in a partnership with the Japanese FinTech firm, Sormi 2, which is the same firm that implemented Cambodia's very successful Bokong CBDC. So why a permissioned blockchain over a public one for sovereign currency? What's the advantage? Control and finality. A permissioned blockchain gives the CBSI complete regulatory oversight. It ensures transaction finality and gives them total control over who can issue or transact the digital currency. This allows them to test the benefits of digital transfer, the low cost, the speed, without sacrificing monetary sovereignty or financial stability. And what are the testing exactly? The scope of the testing is really comprehensive. They're testing retail transactions at selected merchants in Honiera. They're simulating wholesale transfers between the commercial banks. And they're even experimenting with simulated cross-border payments via a public blockchain network called Sora. This proactive experimentation with their own sovereign digital currency, it stands in really sharp contrast to how they treat decentralized private cryptocurrencies. It does. The CBSI has issued very clear and stern warnings that private crypto assets do not have any legal tender status in the Solomon Islands. Their position is quite sophisticated. They are not resistant to digitalization at all, but they insist that any digital currency must be sovereign, regulated, and ultimately under their control to ensure consumer protection and stability. Bokalokash is their vehicle for that controlled digital future. And the CBSI isn't just experimenting with their own currency, they're actively encouraging private sector innovation through these controlled testing spaces. That brings us to the regulatory sandbox. The CBSI regulatory sandbox, which they launched in April 2022, is essential. It provides a safe testing ground where FinTech startups can deploy new products like lending platforms or new wallet designs under the CBSI's direct supervision, but without immediately having to comply with every single burdensome regulation. It's like a safe space to innovate. Precisely. And this is crucial for startups like Iyumi Cash or even larger players like the SI and PF, whose mobile fund digital nano-loan product used the sandbox. It allows the regulator and the innovator to learn together in real time. The CBSI gathers crucial data on consumer adoption, on risk, on fraud mitigation, while the startup gets regulatory clarity and a much faster pass to market if the trial is successful. And looking ahead, the research points to a major legislative change coming in 2025 that could solve the next big problem, which is credit access for this newly banked population. That is the upcoming comprehensive credit reporting regulations 2025. If this is successfully implemented, the Solomon Islands will become the first specific nation with what's called a positive credit reporting regime. What exactly is positive credit reporting? And why is that so transformative for the unbanked? Traditionally, credit reporting often focuses only on defaults and mispayments, negative information. Positive credit reporting means they will collect and share information on good financial behavior. I see, so it's not just about what you do wrong, but what you do right. Exactly. And this is transformative because it expands the data sources that can be used to establish someone's credit worthiness. It could potentially include records of timely mobile airtime top-ups, regular utility bill payments via M-cell-in or small nano-loan repayments. For the vast population that has no traditional bank history, this data finally creates a financial footprint for them. It could unlock access to formal credit and larger loans down the line. It shifts the entire regulatory focus from just inclusion to genuine financial empowerment. This entire deep dive is just a masterclass in market entry strategy for dispersed geographies. So for our listener who might be a fintech strategist or telecom executive, we need to synthesize these lessons into clear, actionable strategic imperatives. Let's start by looking at what worked regionally from Empesa and Kenya to similar projects in Papua, New Guinea. The pattern is universal and it's geographically independent. The number one lesson is that agent network density is the critical bottleneck. If you fail to solve the cash and cash out liquidity problem, the best technology in the world will fail. And Pesa scaled massively based on its 81,000 agents. And what about closer to home in the Pacific? Fiji's Empesa, which is now used by two-thirds of their population, succeeded by tightly integrating utility payments and banking services. And specifically in the Melanesian context, the success of Papua New Guinea's Esopawa Service is highly instructive. It enabled prepaid electricity purchases via airtime. And the research says it blitzed all usage forecasts. It just proves that utilities are the killer use case that forces habit change and drives that daily mobile wallet engagement. OK, so synthesizing EMSL and success in these regional trends, what is the number one strategic imperative for a new company wanting to enter this market? It is investment priority, the agent network. You absolutely must treat the agent network investment as the primary infrastructure buildout, not the technology platform. A new entrant must commit capital to immediately match or more likely exceed EMSL and existing 3000 plus agents. And that focus must be on rural and outer island presence, not just Tonyara. Failure to penetrate the dispersed rural areas means failing to meet the CBSI's NFIS-3 targets, which is the ultimate goal of the government. Building a network of 3000 agents is one thing, but actually running it is another. Especially when we're talking about 2G connectivity and remote islands. What are the operational challenges that define the success or failure of that network on a day-to-day basis? The operational challenges are immense, and they're often overlooked by tech companies. It's not just about recruitment, it's about liquidity management. How do you reliably and affordably move physical cash to 3000 locations scattered across 1,500 kilometers of oceans? You need incredibly robust operational procedures to audit your agent liquidity in a 2G intermittent connectivity environment. You have to mitigate fraud risk, because these agents are handling significant volumes of physical cash. A new entrant must build an operational backbone that can manage this logistical complexity, maybe by leveraging existing supply chain networks like those used by wholesalers or fuel distributors, just to ensure cash is always available. The second imperative, as we've discussed, it relates back to the technological design. Why is the US's D first model the only viable path forward? Because of the existing infrastructure constraints, your product design must be USSD first. We have to reiterate this. 50% reliance on 2G GSM networks and low smartphone penetration around 42% of mobile users means an app-only strategy is an exclusion strategy. It's a non-starter. Furthermore, the service design must prioritize reliability and low connectivity or even intermittent offline environments. You have to anticipate the fragility of that single submarine cable connection. Any new platform must be operable without a consistent high-speed data connection. And the third imperative has to be focused on revenue. Where is the guaranteed high yield transactional volume that justifies this massive infrastructure investment in the first place? That is the revenue anchor, the Remittance corridor. By leveraging partnerships with digital remittance platforms like ClickX or Global Players like Reemoney Transfer, a new entrant can come in and offer fees substantially lower than that disastrous 11.1% average. A strategy that specifically targets the Polym and RSC Scheme flows, which are institutionally guaranteed, high volume, and recurring, will generate the predictable revenue stream necessary to justify the high operational costs of that agent network. Let's talk about the final strategic point. Navigating this proactive but very sophisticated regulatory environment that's led by the CBSI. The imperative here is regulatory alignment and partnership. Your engagement must be proactive. You should plan to participate immediately in the regulatory sandbox to test innovative concepts. And crucially, given that the legal framework for non-bank payment service providers, the non-Telco Fintechs, is still maturing, the recommended initial model is an anchor bank partnership. So don't go it alone. Don't go it alone at first. This allows a new player to leverage an existing commercial bank's compliance infrastructure and their established integration with the new Solot system. It just reduces the regulatory burden while the CBSI finalizes the necessary non-bank payment service provider rules. We've touched on it throughout, but I think we must summarize the core physical and logistical infrastructure constraints that literally define every design choice you can make here. What are the non-negotiable realities for any operator? There are three hard constraints that dictate every feature of your product. First, electricity access. Only 16% of households have grid electricity. This means devices must be low power. Future phones with long battery life are essential. And any charging solution you offer has to be designed for off-grid environments. Early or second? Second, connectivity fragility. The nation relies primarily on a single submarine fiber optic cable. That cable only connects four of the roughly 300 inhabited islands. The rest rely on high latency satellite or microwave links. When that cable is compromised, as it was in May of 2023, a major outage occurs across the connected islands. Your systems must be resilient and designed for delayed synchronization. They have to work offline. And third, the biggest hurdle for financial service is adoption anywhere in the developing world. The massive identification gap. How does a company achieve KYC compliance when only a fraction of the population has a formal ID? That is the ultimate inclusion challenge. Only 30% of the population possesses a boost certificate. And there is no universal national ID system. Therefore, your KYC requirements must be tiered. Was that mean in practice? It means that basic low-value mobile wallets must accommodate minimal identification, perhaps simply the SIM card registration data, which the government is slowly collecting through its new mandate. Higher value accounts, however, must follow more stringent checks. But the strategic opportunity here lies in leveraging those pending comprehensive credit reporting regulations we talked about for 2025. By integrating non-traditional data like utility payment history or mobile usage patterns gathered through the SIM registration, an operator can develop an internal identity score. This would gradually allow customers to migrate from basic, low-limit accounts to higher-value services, effectively solving the KYC gap through data aggregation rather than relying solely on non-existent government documents. So to summarize our deep dive into the Solomon Islands, three core strategic takeaways really emerge for any business looking at these kinds of challenging remote markets. That's right. First, the gap between 70% mobile phone penetration and 25% bank account ownership is not just a statistic, it is the defining explosive market opportunity. Second, the agent network, now numbering over 3,000 strong, is the real scalable physical infrastructure in this archipelago. It is completely and successfully replaced the traditional bank branch model. And third, international remittances from the Palm and RSE schemes, coupled with high frequency utility payments are the guaranteed high-volume revenue anchors that ensure commercial viability and justify the intense capital investment required to operate there. It is truly a remarkable transformation, and it's driven by technological necessity. When you consider the rapid mass adoption of MCEL and across basic feature phones, the implementation of the Solots real-time settlement system and the central bank's bold pilot of Bokalokash, their own sovereign digital currency. The Solomon Islands is not just catching up. No, not at all. It is by necessity becoming one of the best real world testing laboratories on the planet for solving the future of finance in remote, geographically challenged and developing economies. The lessons being learned here about trust, liquidity, and technological minimalism are applicable worldwide. This has been another deep dive into the surprising corners of the global economy.
