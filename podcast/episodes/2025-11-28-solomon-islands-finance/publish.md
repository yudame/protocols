## Description
In a nation where 80% of transactions are cash and only 25% have bank accounts, mobile money service M-SELEN reached 350,000 users in under two years—nearly half the entire population. This episode explores how the Solomon Islands became a global case study in financial leapfrogging: the 3,000-strong agent network replacing bank branches, the $431M remittance opportunity with 11% average fees, USSD-first design for feature phones, and the Bokolo Cash CBDC pilot. Essential listening for anyone considering fintech or telecom market entry in remote, geographically fragmented economies.
