## Description

Exploratory due diligence into the financial and payment infrastructure of the Solomon Islands. In a nation where 80% of transactions are cash and only 25% of the population has bank accounts, mobile money platform M-SELEN has captured 350,000 users in under two years. This episode examines the practical realities facing a potential telecom market entrant: geographic challenges across 1,000 islands, the $8.67 average cost just to reach a financial access point, the 11% fees on the $431M remittance market, and the competitive landscape dominated by the incumbent's proprietary mobile money system.
