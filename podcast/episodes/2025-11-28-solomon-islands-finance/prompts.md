## Research Phase

### Research Prompt

**Tools Used:** Gemini Deep Research, Claude

**Prompt:**
```
Research the financial ecosystem and payment infrastructure in the Solomon Islands.

**Context:** Target audience is intelligent listeners interested in understanding how financial
systems work in developing Pacific Island nations, with practical implications for someone
considering entering the telecommunications market there. Cover the full spectrum from
traditional cash economies to emerging digital payment solutions.

**Key areas to explore:**

1. Current payment landscape
   - Cash vs. digital payment prevalence
   - Mobile money adoption and platforms (e.g., M-Sese, YouSave)
   - Banking infrastructure and access rates
   - Point-of-sale systems in urban vs. rural areas

2. Utility and bill payment systems
   - How do Solomon Islanders pay for electricity (Solomon Power), water, and existing telecom services?
   - Pre-paid vs. post-paid models
   - Payment channels available (bank, mobile, agent networks)

3. Remittance flows
   - Scale of remittances from diaspora (Australia, New Zealand, seasonal workers)
   - Current remittance channels (Western Union, KlickEx, bank transfers)
   - Fees, friction points, and receiving mechanisms
   - How recipients access and use remittance funds

4. Income segments
   - Financial behaviors of middle and high-income urban residents (Honiara)
   - Banking relationships, payment preferences, smartphone penetration

5. Regulatory environment
   - Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) stance on digital payments
   - Licensing requirements for payment service providers
   - Any existing crypto/stablecoin regulations or guidance

6. Emerging and potential payment solutions
   - Regional payment integration (Pacific islands initiatives)
   - Stablecoin possibilities - existing on/off-ramp services, if any
   - International examples of successful telecom-led payment systems in similar markets

**Research methodology:**
- Prioritize official sources: CBSI reports, World Bank financial inclusion data, IMF assessments
- Distinguish between urban (Honiara) and rural realities
- Note infrastructure constraints (internet connectivity, electricity access)
- Include specific statistics on banking penetration, mobile ownership, remittance volumes
- Identify gaps in current systems that represent opportunities
- Report on any pilot programs or recent developments (2023-2025)
- Note challenges: geography (900+ islands), population distribution, infrastructure limitations

**Output:** Comprehensive research report with specific data points, named services/providers,
regulatory citations, and source links throughout.
