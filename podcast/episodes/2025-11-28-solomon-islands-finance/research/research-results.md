Strategic Assessment of the Financial Ecosystem and Payment Infrastructure in the Solomon Islands: Implications for Telecommunications Market EntryI. Executive Summary: Strategic Imperatives for Digital Market EntryThe Solomon Islands (SI) presents a nascent but structurally challenging environment for digital financial services (DFS), defined by a deep-seated reliance on cash, extreme geographic centralization of banking infrastructure, and aggressive regulatory mandates for financial inclusion. The retail payments ecosystem remains heavily cash-dominant, accounting for 80% of all transactions in 2020.1 However, this institutional friction creates significant opportunities for a telecommunications (telecom) operator, whose core asset—the nationwide distribution network—directly addresses the structural deficiencies of the traditional banking sector.1.1. Key Findings: Market Viability, Concentration Risk, and Infrastructure GapsThe market is characterized by severe concentration risk, with over 70% of the country’s 59 ATMs located in the capital, Honiara.1 This centralization contributes to the exclusion of 73.3% of the rural population from digital commerce.2 To address this, the Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3) sets clear goals for 2025: increasing active financial accounts to 400,000 and access points to 1,155.3 A telecom entrant’s strategic investment in expanding the agent network is critical, as it aligns perfectly with this national objective.Crucially, existing partnership models, such as the successful YouSave LoMobile micro-pension scheme, validate the regulatory acceptance of using airtime distribution channels for financial services.4 This precedent provides a blueprint for rapid agent conversion. Furthermore, the burgeoning international remittance market, which reached a record SBD 431 million in 2024 5, is burdened by high costs (averaging 11.1%) 6, offering a high-yield opportunity for digital cost arbitrage.1.2. High-Priority Recommendations for Telecom OperatorsPrioritize Remittance and Utility Use Cases: Anchor the mobile money business model in institutional, high-volume flows. Immediately target the SBD 431 million remittance market by offering substantially lower fees than the current 11.1% average.5 Simultaneously, leverage the existing consumer behavior of using mobile top-up for Solomon Power’s Cashpower meters 7 to ensure high-frequency customer retention and immediate wallet activation.Rapid Agent Network Expansion: Commit capital to meet or exceed the NFIS3 target of 1,155 access points.3 The strategy should focus on converting the existing, trusted airtime agent network into regulated cash-in/cash-out (CICO) financial agents, supported by advanced liquidity management technology to prevent rural cash dry-up.Proactive Regulatory Engagement: Utilize the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI)’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox 8 to test innovative, potentially regional payment solutions (e.g., in anticipation of the Pacific Payments Mechanism).9 Due to the current absence of a finalized regulatory framework for non-bank Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and strict bank licensing requirements (minimum SBD 5 million capital) 10, the immediate operational model should be structured as a partnership with an established commercial bank.II. Foundational Market Dynamics and Economic Context2.1. Socio-Economic Profile and Geographic ConcentrationThe Solomon Islands economy is characterized by a significant geographic disparity in access to formal services. The distribution of banking infrastructure is severely limited and overwhelmingly concentrated in the capital, Honiara.1 The nation's four commercial banks operate only 15 branches nationwide, with an even more pronounced concentration of automated teller machines (ATMs). Of the total 59 ATMs across the country, over 70% are located in Honiara.1This centralization has profound implications for financial inclusion. Data shows that digital economic activity, including usage for social media, communications, and entertainment, is dominated by Honiara residents, who comprise 54.1% to 56.5% of users in these categories.11 Conversely, the rural population faces systemic exclusion. Research indicates that 73.3% of rural residents are excluded from digital commerce due to critical, foundational barriers, including fragmented logistics, absent delivery infrastructure, and a severe lack of payment options.2The extreme centralization of physical banking points suggests that the primary obstacle to widespread financial access is not merely a lack of digital literacy but the inability to securely and efficiently move cash across the islands. Therefore, any viable digital strategy must directly address this liquidity and distribution gap by transforming the telecom’s widely dispersed, non-traditional infrastructure into a secure, regulated financial agent network. The success of a mobile money operation will be directly dependent on its ability to manage the velocity and security of cash flow in these underserved rural communities.Table 1: Geographic Concentration of Financial Access PointsAccess Point TypeTotal NationwideConcentration in HoniaraStrategic ImplicationCommercial Bank Branches15Limited data, presumed highTraditional banking infrastructure is non-viable for mass outreach.ATMs59>70%Digital strategy must decouple cash access from physical bank location (Agent-led CICO).Mobile Money Agents (M-SELEN)250+Focus on nationwide expansionThis network is the crucial channel for meeting NFIS3 access targets outside the capital.2.2. The Predominance of the Cash Economy and Financial FrictionThe reliance on physical currency is deeply embedded in the SI economy. In 2020, cash accounted for a substantial 80% of all transactions.1 Despite the availability of supportive financial infrastructure, the usage of electronic payment methods, such as cards, mobile money wallets, and online banking, remains limited.1While cards are utilized, the volume of card transactions has remained almost stable in recent years, with over 90% of transactions occurring at ATMs primarily for cash withdrawal.1 The average value of an ATM transaction (SBD 542) is relatively close to the average EFTPOS transaction value (SBD 860 in 2022).1 This data suggests that EFTPOS systems have failed to penetrate the high-frequency, low-value retail market that characterizes daily consumer spending. The market demonstrates significant behavioral inertia and resistance to traditional card systems, likely due to high merchant acquisition costs, consumer unfamiliarity, or terminal reliability issues.To effectively introduce digital finance, the strategy must avoid replicating the high-cost card ecosystem. Instead, the entry must leverage existing high mobile penetration (66% of the population have mobile connections) 2 to rapidly deploy lower-cost interfaces such as USSD or Quick Response (QR) codes. These solutions bypass the need for expensive dedicated EFTPOS hardware, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for micro- and small-scale merchants.2.3. The Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3): A Regulatory Mandate for Digital GrowthThe strategic direction of the Solomon Islands financial sector is guided by the Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3), set by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI). NFIS3, premised on the G20 Principles for Innovative Financial Inclusion, sets aggressive, measurable goals to be achieved by 2025.3Key national targets include increasing active users of financial accounts from a baseline of 283,954 to 400,000, with a specific focus on gender equity, requiring 50% of the new user base to be women. Furthermore, the strategy mandates a significant expansion of physical access points nationwide, from 825 to 1,155.3 The stated strategic objectives explicitly amplify the need to increase the reach and quality of digital financial services, and specifically include women, youth, and rural adults as fully engaged participants.3This government-mandated roadmap, developed in consultation with key public and private entities, including the World Bank Group 13, provides a crucial framework for any telecom market entrant. The explicit targets for increasing both the user base and the number of access points create a clear path for collaboration. Any private sector investment, particularly from a telecom, that demonstrably contributes to achieving the goal of 1,155 access points will gain significant regulatory alignment, potentially leading to preferential treatment, access to public development funding, and reduced regulatory friction during complex licensing and operational scaling phases. Regulatory alignment is thus a fundamental source of competitive advantage in the SI market.III. Payment System Infrastructure and Modernization3.1. Central Bank Modernization: The Solomons Automated Transfer System (SOLATS)Recognizing the need to modernize its outdated payment systems, the CBSI launched the Solomons Automated Transfer System (SOLATS) in April 2024.14 SOLATS functions as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payment system, a significant step toward improving efficiency and strengthening security within the national financial infrastructure. This modernization effort is intended to support the digitalization of the economy and drive inclusive, sustainable economic development.14The development of SOLATS received technical expertise and financial support from the World Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the governments of Australia and New Zealand. This follows similar payment transformations implemented by central banks in other Pacific nations, including Fiji, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu.14The launch of SOLATS is the critical foundational step required for the scalability and reliability of mobile money operations. Prior to SOLATS, manual cheque clearing was common for interbank payments, leading to delays and settlement risks.1 The RTGS mechanism eliminates these settlement delays and ensures secure, efficient movement of funds between commercial banks and the segregated accounts maintained by mobile money providers. This reduces the systemic liquidity risk for providers and agents alike, making high-volume, high-frequency digital transactions feasible. Compliance with the CBSI National Payment System (SOLATS) is therefore a non-negotiable requirement for any prospective financial institution or banking system partner.103.2. The Interoperability Barrier and Regulatory Push for a National SwitchDespite the technological advancements of SOLATS, the retail payments ecosystem faces several cross-cutting challenges that constrain digital adoption, including limited infrastructure, identification barriers, heavy cash reliance, and significant regulatory gaps.1 A core technical friction point is the current absence of interoperability among providers. Although mobile money wallets have been introduced, they have few active users and currently lack the ability to transact across providers.1The fragmentation caused by the lack of interoperability severely limits the utility of digital wallets, hindering network effects essential for mass adoption. To resolve this, a key focus action identified by market analysis is the implementation of a fully interoperable digital payments infrastructure, potentially through an optimal centralized model.1 Regulators and the Central Bank are currently evaluating the most effective approach—whether market-led, regulator-guided, or regulator-led—to establish a national switch with unified rules and standards.1The CBSI’s current assessment phase presents a strategic opportunity for a telecom entrant to influence the future market structure. By initiating proactive and constructive engagement with CBSI during the national switch design phase, the telecom can contribute technical expertise and commit to immediate integration using standardized protocols (e.g., open APIs). This participation can help steer the technical and commercial standards of the national switch, ensuring the final framework is technically and commercially optimized for the telecom’s platform, thus minimizing potentially costly, reactive technical compliance adjustments later.IV. The Mobile Financial Services Ecosystem: Blueprints for Success4.1. Analysis of Existing Mobile Money Models (M-SELEN and YouSave)Current digital payment solutions, though nascent, offer vital lessons and regulatory precedents for market entry.M-SELENM-SELEN represents a general mobile money service that has onboarded more than 20,000 users and established an agent network of over 250 agents nationwide.15 The service emphasizes cash-in, cash-out (CICO), person-to-person (P2P) transfers, and has recently expanded to include utility bill payments and merchant payments for retail use.15 A critical focus for the platform is the continuous development of a reliable agent network to ensure service availability and accessibility across the country, a recognition of the geographic challenges present in the islands.15YouSave LoMobileThe YouSave LoMobile service, managed by the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SINPF), is arguably the most strategically important case study for a telecom entrant. Launched in 2017, this micropension product successfully targets the informal sector by uniquely leveraging airtime deposits for savings.16 This service is a culmination of a successful public-private partnership involving the SINPF, Solomon Telekom, Bmobile, CBSI, and the Solomon Islands Government (SIG), supported by UNCDF funding.4 The mechanism allows deposits ranging from a minimum of SBD 10 to a maximum of SBD 1,000 per transaction, done simply by dialing a USSD code and confirming the amount from a pre-paid airtime balance.17The YouSave LoMobile model is the single most important proof of concept for the telecom sector. It provides irrefutable validation that the CBSI and SIG are willing to accept the telecom’s existing airtime distribution infrastructure—the most extensive distribution network in the country—as a legitimate and regulated financial conduit. This success establishes a clear blueprint for the rapid conversion of existing airtime top-up agents into regulated CICO financial agents for general mobile money services, allowing a swift scaling operation without the need to build a new network from scratch.4.2. Viability Constraints and Lessons from the Pacific RegionWhile the potential for digital finance is high, market viability in the Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) presents unique challenges that must be addressed proactively. A decade of data from the region shows that, with the notable exception of M-PAiSA in Fiji, many early Digital Financial Services (DFS) models have either downscaled significantly or discontinued operations entirely after initial periods of success.18This historical pattern is largely attributed to the small population sizes of island nations, which make it difficult to achieve the high transaction volumes typically required for a sustainable, profitable mobile money business model.18 Furthermore, PICs face high operational costs related to technology development, staff training, and maintaining resilient infrastructure across dispersed geographies.19A mobile money operation in the Solomon Islands cannot rely solely on low-margin P2P transactions to generate adequate revenue. To ensure long-term commercial sustainability, the business model must be structurally anchored in capturing the transactional value of high-volume, high-value, guaranteed institutional payments. Strategic focus should be placed on capturing flows such as international remittances, Government-to-Person (G2P) payments, and utility collections, which generate the necessary revenue velocity to offset the high operating expenses inherent in geographically fragmented island nations. The underlying technology infrastructure must also be designed for stability, security, and consistent availability.19V. Strategic Payment Use Cases for Market PenetrationThe strategy for market entry must be centered on capturing specific payment flows where cash friction is highest and digital alternatives provide the most pronounced cost and convenience advantage.5.1. Remittance Flows: A High-Yield OpportunityRemittances represent the single most immediate and lucrative target for a digital payment system. Driven significantly by Solomon Islanders participating in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme, international remittances reached a record-breaking SBD 431 million in 2024, representing an increase of more than 70% from the previous year.5 These flows are critical to the national economy and individual welfare, with funds typically used by families for school fees, housing construction, and starting new businesses.5Despite the critical importance of these funds, the cost of formal transfers is exorbitant. The average cost of sending USD 200 to the Solomon Islands currently stands at 11.1%, which is four times higher than the global average cost of 6.35%.6 This high transaction cost represents an immense friction point and, consequently, a massive opportunity for cost arbitrage through digital services.A low-cost, mobile-to-wallet remittance solution can instantly capture market share by targeting a competitive fee structure (e.g., 5-6%). Furthermore, capturing the international flow naturally drives the volume of domestic transfers, which currently operate highly inefficiently. Domestic remittances are 72% cash-based, with only 28% utilizing formal channels.6 Formalizing this 72% cash flow through P2P mobile transfer capabilities will generate substantial, high-volume revenue from internal transactions, driving utilization and enhancing security for users currently relying on risky physical cash transfer methods.5.2. Utility and Bill Payments AggregationUtility payments provide the essential high-frequency use case necessary for retaining active wallet users. Solomon Power, the national electricity provider, utilizes both post-paid (kW meter) and pre-paid (Cashpower) metering systems.7Crucially, the purchase of electricity tokens for Cashpower meters is already supported via mobile top-up 24/7, offering a highly convenient and economical means of managing power usage.7 This existing behavior validates the market's willingness to use the mobile device as the primary interface for essential service payments. Solomon Water, the national water service provider, also supports payments through direct deposits or online banking via ANZ, Bank South Pacific (BSP), and BRED Bank.20 Existing mobile money providers, such as M-SELEN, have already introduced utility bill payment capabilities.15The strategic priority for the telecom entrant must be to integrate Cashpower token generation seamlessly and directly into its mobile wallet platform. This integration should offer superior functionality and convenience compared to basic mobile top-up, positioning the mobile wallet as the definitive 24/7 payment mechanism for the majority of the population. This use case guarantees a high frequency of transactions, crucial for establishing habitual wallet usage and ensuring high customer retention rates, serving as a powerful counterpoint to the traditional, time-consuming counter payments required by Solomon Power for post-paid services.21Table 2: Analysis of Payment Friction and Digital OpportunityUse CaseCurrent StateFriction/CostTelecom OpportunityInternational RemittancesRecord SBD 431M (2024), High Growth 5Average cost: 11.1% 6Low-cost, mobile-to-wallet service; significant arbitrage potential and capturing PALM scheme flows.Domestic Remittances72% done in physical cash 6High security risk, lack of traceability.P2P mobile transfer replacing cash flows; drives agent CICO volume and network utility.Utility Payments (Cashpower)Via mobile top-up already established 7Inefficient integration, limited functionality across utility providers.Seamless 24/7 mobile wallet integration for high-frequency use and customer retention.Retail/E-commerceExcluded 73.3% of rural population 2Lack of payment/logistics infrastructure.Merchant payment solutions (QR/USSD) and strategic logistics partnership.5.3. E-commerce and Retail PaymentsThe potential for e-commerce remains largely untapped, constrained by systemic issues that transcend payment technology alone. The National E-commerce Strategy 2022-2027 identifies logistics, payments, and rural-urban integration as critical barriers, keeping 73.3% of the rural population excluded from digital commerce.2 Successful local initiatives, such as the start-up Toro, have acknowledged the need for simultaneous solutions encompassing a marketplace, payment solutions, and delivery networks.2For a telecom entrant, focusing solely on rolling out merchant payment solutions (e.g., QR/USSD) will not generate sufficient transaction volume unless the underlying logistical and market integration challenges are resolved. A holistic approach is required. The introduction of merchant payments is necessary 15, but this must be paired with strategic partnerships with established or emerging local e-commerce and logistics providers, such as Toro.2 Co-developing payment rails that accommodate the fragmented delivery infrastructure will ensure that digital payments are viable endpoints for transactions, allowing the telecom to capture payment volume and accelerate the inclusion of the currently excluded rural majority.VI. Regulatory Framework and Innovation Pathways6.1. CBSI Licensing and Regulatory GapsThe regulatory landscape is in a transitional phase, marked by stringent traditional banking requirements juxtaposed with acknowledged gaps regarding non-bank Payment Service Providers (PSPs). Licensing for banking institutions, for instance, mandates a minimum paid-up capital or assigned capital of SBD 5 million for a subsidiary or branch operation.10 Furthermore, applicants must demonstrate systems compatibility with the new CBSI National Payment System (SOLATS).10While NFIS3 strongly supports digital finance, the official framework for licensing and overseeing non-bank PSPs offering mobile money services is still evolving. Regulatory gaps have been identified as a constraint on the adoption of digital payment methods.1To mitigate the risk associated with an uncertain non-bank PSP framework, the recommended market entry structure involves an initial bank-led partnership model. Under this approach, the mobile money service operates as a licensed agent or technical provider to an existing commercial bank (e.g., BSP or ANZ), allowing the telecom to leverage the bank's established regulatory compliance, including immediate compatibility with SOLATS, while the CBSI works to finalize a dedicated, perhaps tiered, framework for non-bank entities. This approach minimizes regulatory friction during the crucial scaling phase.6.2. The CBSI FinTech Regulatory SandboxThe CBSI offers a FinTech Regulatory Sandbox Framework, which outlines guidelines for admitting and testing proposed product solutions under the close supervision of the Central Bank.8 This framework is specifically designed to enable the controlled testing of new financial products and services.The Sandbox provides a low-risk environment for a telecom entrant to test advanced and potentially disruptive features that could create a competitive advantage. This is particularly relevant given the regional conversation regarding new financial technologies. For instance, testing advanced cross-border payment protocols or exploring the potential role of digital assets and stablecoins—a topic gaining traction in the Pacific due to their potential to substitute for contracting traditional banking networks 22—can be safely executed within the Sandbox.8 By testing innovative solutions here, the telecom can not only gain first-mover operational experience but also proactively contribute data and expertise to CBSI’s policy formulation, positioning itself as a leader in digital innovation while strictly maintaining adherence to controlled supervision.6.3. Regional Payment System EvolutionThe movement toward regional economic integration is placing increasing pressure on high payment costs. Across the Pacific Islands, the contraction of traditional banking networks is driving governments and institutions to explore digital payment systems as a necessary substitute.22In response to the extremely high transaction costs, which currently afflict the Solomon Islands (11.1% average remittance cost) 6, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat is actively advancing a project that includes a Feasibility Study for a Pacific Payments Mechanism (PPM).9 This mechanism is intended to serve as a regional payment aggregation platform aimed at improving economies of scale, reducing costs, and strengthening cross-border connectivity among Pacific markets.9The high-volume international remittance opportunity (SBD 431 million) 5 is directly tied to the outcome of this regional initiative. The telecom’s long-term remittance strategy must be future-proofed by ensuring its technological platform is capable of integrating with or facilitating standardized regional transfers, such as the proposed PPM. Investing in a system architecture that anticipates and accommodates regional interoperability will ensure that the platform remains cost-competitive and scalable as PALM scheme flows and regional digital trade continue to grow.VII. Strategic Recommendations for Telecom Market Entry (The Action Plan)The following action plan translates the ecosystem analysis into specific, sequential strategic imperatives for a telecommunications operator entering the Solomon Islands DFS market.7.1. Agent Network and Liquidity Management StrategyThe agent network is the operational bottleneck for financial inclusion and must be prioritized over all other infrastructural concerns.7.1.1. Strategic Conversion and NFIS3 ComplianceThe telecom must commit significant capital immediately to meet the National Financial Inclusion Strategy’s access target, committing to the expansion of access points from the current number to 1,155 by 2025.3 This is best achieved through a strategy of conversion over creation. The most efficient pathway involves leveraging the validated success of the YouSave LoMobile model 4 by rapidly converting thousands of existing, trusted airtime and mobile top-up agents into regulated CICO agents under the mobile money license (secured via a bank partner). This conversion significantly accelerates network reach and immediately addresses the structural geographic concentration risk.17.1.2. Critical Investment in Liquidity TechnologyTo prevent operational failure, the telecom must invest heavily in robust, predictive data systems for cash flow and float management. Historically, the failure of DFS in small island nations has often been attributed to agents running out of cash float in rural areas (agent 'dry-up'), crippling service availability.18 The liquidity system must use transactional data and geographic mapping to anticipate cash demand spikes and efficiently manage the logistics of replenishing agent floats, thereby ensuring service resilience and consumer trust outside Honiara.7.2. Product Development and Revenue RoadmapsThe product roadmap must focus on institutional flows to guarantee viability in the small market environment.7.2.1. Product A: Low-Cost Remittance Corridor (Revenue Anchor)The primary revenue focus must be capturing the SBD 431 million international remittance flow.5 This requires establishing a competitive advantage by offering transaction costs that significantly undercut the prevailing 11.1% average.6 The telecom should establish robust connections with major international Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) and target PALM scheme workers in Australia. Simultaneously, the platform must facilitate secure, low-cost domestic P2P transfers to formalize the 72% of domestic remittances currently conducted in cash.67.2.2. Product B: Utility Aggregator (Retention Driver)A deep, seamless integration with utility providers is mandatory for customer retention. The telecom must secure direct integration with Solomon Power, allowing customers to purchase Cashpower tokens 24/7 directly through the mobile wallet interface, replacing the current, less functional mobile top-up process.7 Integration with Solomon Water and other recurring billers (e.g., insurance, school fees) must be secured to establish the mobile wallet as the default mechanism for household financial management.7.2.3. Product C: G2P/P2G Payments (Regulatory Enabler)To position the telecom as a critical national partner, partnerships should be established with Government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Building on the YouSave model 4, the platform should facilitate G2P payments (e.g., benefits, disaster relief), Person-to-Government (P2G) payments (e.g., taxes, fees), and government salary disbursements. This integration strengthens regulatory ties, increases the volume of "sticky" funds within the mobile ecosystem, and reinforces the telecom’s role in advancing national fiscal efficiency.7.3. Interoperability and Regulatory Alignment Strategy7.3.1. Proactive Engagement and National Switch InfluenceGiven the CBSI’s acknowledged need for interoperability and its assessment of national switch models 1, the telecom must proactively engage the Central Bank. A specialized team should be assigned to provide technical input on the design and regulatory requirements of the future National Switch. This engagement seeks to influence the architectural standards of the switch, ensuring the final design minimizes future integration costs and leverages the telecom’s technological capabilities.7.3.2. Structural Compliance ModelTo address current regulatory ambiguity regarding non-bank PSPs 1, the entry structure must initially be built upon a secure, bank-partnered model. This structure ensures immediate compliance with CBSI regulatory expectations, including the mandatory integration standards of SOLATS.10 Once the non-bank PSP framework matures, the telecom can transition towards greater operational independence, potentially utilizing the Regulatory Sandbox 8 to test novel, non-traditional services outside the existing banking parameters.7.4. Strategic Partnership and Ecosystem DevelopmentSuccessful scaling requires comprehensive partnerships that mitigate geographic and logistical deficiencies.Banking Partnerships: Secure formalized partnership agreements with at least two of the commercial banks (e.g., BSP, ANZ, BRED) for custodial accounts, seamless float management, and integration with the SOLATS RTGS system.14E-commerce/Logistics Alliances: Partner with emerging local e-commerce leaders, such as Toro 2, and logistics providers. The aim is to co-develop integrated digital payment and delivery solutions, which is essential to address the fragmentation barriers that exclude the 73.3% of the rural population from digital commerce.2VIII. ConclusionThe Solomon Islands financial ecosystem presents a unique dichotomy: pervasive market friction and infrastructure deficit coexisting with strong regulatory urgency for digital inclusion. The dominance of cash (80% of transactions) 1 and the immense cost of remittances (11.1%) 6 provide the economic rationale for digital disruption. The political and regulatory framework, embodied by NFIS3’s explicit targets 3 and the proven success of the airtime-linked YouSave model 4, provides the necessary roadmap and precedent for a telecom-led market entry.Success for a telecom entrant is predicated on a commitment to solving the core distributional challenge by aggressively scaling a regulated agent network, aligning with the NFIS3 targets. The strategy must be anchored in high-velocity, high-yield institutional use cases—specifically, capturing the booming international remittance flow (SBD 431 million) 5 and dominating the high-frequency utility payment market through integration with Solomon Power Cashpower.7 By adopting a bank-partnered structure initially and leveraging the CBSI Regulatory Sandbox for future innovations, the telecom can navigate regulatory uncertainty while establishing market dominance, driving meaningful financial inclusion, and securing long-term commercial viability in the Pacific market.

## Research from Claude

# Financial ecosystem and payment infrastructure in the Solomon Islands

The Solomon Islands presents a **largely untapped financial market** where 75% of the population lacks bank accounts, yet mobile phone penetration reaches 70%—a gap that represents significant opportunity for telecom-led payment services. Since June 2023, the mobile money service M-SELEN has grown from zero to **350,000 users**, demonstrating powerful latent demand for digital financial services in this archipelago of 900+ islands. For a telecom market entrant, the critical insight is that success depends not on sophisticated technology but on agent network density, feature-phone compatibility, and integration with the remittance corridor from Australia and New Zealand's seasonal worker programs.

## Cash still dominates despite rapid mobile money growth

The Solomon Islands remains predominantly a **cash economy, with 80% of all transactions conducted in physical currency**. This cash dependency persists despite recent infrastructure investments because banking services cluster in Honiara—the capital holds 70% of bank branches, 83% of ATMs, and 72% of EFTPOS terminals while 75% of the population lives rurally across scattered islands.

Four commercial banks operate in the country: **Bank of South Pacific (BSP)** dominates with 8 branches, 28 ATMs, and the only agency banking presence outside Guadalcanal province. ANZ maintains multiple branches in major locations, while BRED Bank (French cooperative, entered 2016) operates 2 branches and 13 ATMs exclusively in Honiara. Pan Oceanic Bank serves a limited market and doesn't issue cards. The entire nation has just **15 bank branches, 59 ATMs, and 423 EFTPOS terminals** serving approximately 740,000 people.

Financial inclusion statistics reveal the opportunity scale: only **25% of the population owns a bank account**, 34% access any formal financial services, 35% rely on informal moneylenders, and 31% remain completely excluded. Women face a **12% gender gap** in account ownership. The average cost to travel one-way to a financial access point is **US$8.67**, with 30% of customers using boats or canoes.

Mobile money has begun disrupting this landscape. **M-SELEN**, launched by Our Telekom in June 2023 with Australian government and UNCDF support, has achieved remarkable growth—from 20,000 users and 250 agents at launch to **350,000 users and 3,000+ agents by early 2025**. The service works on any phone via USSD code (*673#), enabling cash-in/out, person-to-person transfers, utility bill payments, merchant payments via QR code, and international remittance receiving through KlickEx partnership. Competing services include **EziPei** (operated by Solomon Post using patented SIM-Skin technology that works across networks) and **IumiCash** (QR-based, smartphone-only, limited adoption).

## Prepaid utilities create natural payment touchpoints

Solomon Islanders' utility payment behaviors offer clear entry points for payment service integration. **Solomon Power** operates predominantly on a **prepaid Cashpower meter system** where customers purchase electricity tokens keyed into meters—mirroring the prepaid airtime model that drives telecom revenue. Post-paid kilowatt meters exist primarily for commercial customers with 15-day payment terms.

Payment channels for electricity include cash over counter at Solomon Power offices, EFTPOS (accepting Visa, MasterCard, JCB, Cirrus, PLUS, UnionPay), BSP Mobile Banking top-ups, and increasingly M-SELEN. Solomon Power maintains presence in Honiara and 9 provincial outstations (Auki, Buala, Gizo, Kirakira, Lata, Malu'u, Noro-Munda, Tulagi). However, **only 14% of the population has electricity access**—87% of installed generation capacity serves Honiara.

**Solomon Water** operates on a post-paid monthly billing model with payments accepted at Customer Care Centres, via BSP Mobile Banking, and through a new mobile application launched in 2025. Service coverage extends to Honiara, Auki, Tulagi, Noro, and Gizo only.

Telecom top-ups represent the highest-frequency payment activity. Both **Our Telekom** (80%+ market share, nationwide coverage) and **bmobile-Vodafone** (~20% share, 4 provinces only) operate on prepaid SIM models with top-ups available through retail agents, M-SELEN, and BSP Mobile Banking. The innovative **YouSave LoMobile** program—a world-first launched in 2019—allows mobile airtime top-ups to convert directly into pension savings through the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, demonstrating how telecom rails can enable financial services beyond payments.

## Seasonal worker remittances represent a high-growth corridor

Remittance flows to the Solomon Islands total approximately **US$85-89 million annually**, representing about 5% of GDP—lower than remittance-dependent neighbors like Tonga (41% of GDP) or Samoa (28%) but growing rapidly due to labor mobility programs. The CBSI reported nearly **SBD$200 million** in remittances from labour mobility programs alone in 2023.

The primary source countries are **Australia** (via the PALM scheme—Pacific Australia Labour Mobility) and **New Zealand** (via the RSE scheme—Recognised Seasonal Employer). As of mid-2024, **7,600+ Solomon Islanders** work under PALM, making Solomon Islands the largest Pacific source country for the program. New Zealand hosts **1,100+ RSE workers**, with the program experiencing its first year exceeding 1,000 workers. Combined, approximately **8,700 seasonal workers** are deployed abroad, with 15,000+ in queue and government targets of 16,000 workers by 2028.

Current remittance channels include:

- **Western Union**: Available through BSP branches and Solomon Islands Post offices for cash pickup, though online sending FROM Solomon Islands is no longer available
- **KlickEx**: New Zealand-based digital platform partnered with M-SELEN for direct mobile wallet transfers, with recipients cashing out at 1,000+ M-SELEN agent outlets
- **Bank transfers**: BSP and ANZ offer international transfers; ANZ charges AUD$7 flat fee for Pacific transfers under AUD$10,000

The critical friction point is **cost**. Pacific remittance corridors rank among the world's most expensive—the Australia-to-Solomon Islands corridor costs an estimated **15-20%** (compared to the global average of 6.49% and the SDG target of 3%). This premium derives from cash-to-cash service dominance (highest overhead), thin competition, compliance costs from bank de-risking, and hidden exchange rate margins layered on top of visible fees.

Last-mile delivery to outer islands remains challenging: limited banking infrastructure, patchy mobile coverage (some areas have 2G only or none), and dependence on physical agents concentrated in population centers. M-SELEN's agent network expansion addresses this gap but coverage remains incomplete.

## The regulatory framework supports innovation while gaps persist

The **Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI)** serves as the primary regulator, with explicit mandate under Section 9(n) of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands Act 2012 to "promote financial inclusion and related activities." The regulatory environment has modernized significantly since 2022 but implementation gaps remain.

Key legislation includes:

- **National Payment Systems Act 2022** (enacted October 2022): Landmark law enabling payment system modernization and CBSI oversight of payment service providers—though the IMF's 2024 Article IV report notes regulations to operationalize this Act remain pending
- **Financial Institutions Act 1998**: Primary licensing framework for banking business, including capital adequacy, asset classification, liquidity management, and large exposure limits
- **Exchange Control Act 1976**: Governs foreign exchange licensing—operating without a license is a serious offense

The **Regulatory Sandbox Framework** launched April 2022 provides a controlled testing environment for fintech innovations including mobile money, payment service providers, remittances, and MSME financing. **ACCountplan** became the first successful sandbox applicant in August 2023, testing a cross-regional remittance application.

The **National Financial Inclusion Strategy 3 (2021-2025)** sets explicit targets: increase individuals with formal financial accounts from 283,000 to 400,000 (50% women) and expand access points from 825 to 1,155. Six strategic objectives emphasize digital financial services, MSME finance, women/youth/rural inclusion, and financial literacy.

On **cryptocurrency**, CBSI has issued clear warnings that cryptocurrencies "do not have any legal tender status" and "strongly discourages the public to invest" due to speculative risks. No regulatory framework governs crypto trading, taxation, or service providers—it exists in a legal gray area (not prohibited but not regulated).

The most significant emerging development is **Bokolo Cash**, a Central Bank Digital Currency proof-of-concept launched November 2023 with Japanese government funding and Soramitsu (the company behind Cambodia's Bakong CBDC) as technical partner. Built on Hyperledger Iroha 2 permissioned blockchain, Bokolo Cash is pegged 1:1 to the Solomon Islands dollar, uses two-tier KYC verification, and is testing retail transactions, wholesale interbank transfers, and simulated cross-border payments via the SORA public blockchain. The CBSI (Amendment) Act 2023 provides legislative foundation for digital currency developments.

## Payment system infrastructure reached a milestone in 2024

The April 2024 launch of **SOLATS (Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System)** represents a fundamental infrastructure upgrade. This real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system—developed with IFC/World Bank technical assistance and Australian/New Zealand funding—replaces manual cheque clearing that previously required 2-3 day settlement. Interbank transfers now process in approximately 10 minutes.

A **Central Securities Depository** linked to SOLATS enables electronic registry for government and central bank securities trading in real time. These systems create the backbone for lower-cost digital payments, faster settlement, and eventual interoperability with regional payment networks.

Regional integration remains nascent but accelerating. Cross-border mobile money links now connect Fiji-Cook Islands (April 2024) and Fiji-Vanuatu (2023). **Digicel's MyCash Pacific Transfers** enables instant transfers between Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Solomon Islands could eventually join this Pacific mobile money network, dramatically reducing remittance costs for diaspora workers.

The upcoming **Comprehensive Credit Reporting Regulations 2025** (effective September 2025) will make Solomon Islands the first Pacific nation with a positive credit reporting regime—expanding data sources to utility records and voter files, potentially enabling credit scoring for the previously unbanked.

## Telecom-led payment success requires agent networks and simplicity

International experience from similar markets reveals success factors for telecom payment services:

**M-Pesa (Kenya)**: The canonical success story grew financial inclusion from 26% (2006) to 84% (2021) with 30.2 million active users. Critical factors included Safaricom's 77% mobile market share at launch providing distribution advantage, an **agent network of 81,025 outlets** forming the operational backbone, simple "send money home" value proposition on basic handsets via SIM toolkit, transparent pricing undercutting bank fees, regulatory flexibility via "test-and-learn" approach, and eventual bank partnerships rather than competition.

**Fiji (M-PAiSA and MyCash)**: Demonstrates Pacific success—632,123 users representing over two-thirds of the population, 316% year-over-year growth in P2P transactions, FJ$83.6 million in e-money circulation. Phase 3 of Fiji's National Payment System now enables direct bank-to-mobile wallet transfers, and cross-border links to Vanuatu and Cook Islands extend utility.

**Papua New Guinea (CellMoni)**: Digicel's service reached 1.6 million individual users (53% of Digicel's customer base). Notably, **EasiPawa**—prepaid electricity via airtime—"blitzed all usage forecasts," demonstrating the power of utility integration. However, Digicel's 91% market share creates near-monopoly conditions limiting competitive dynamics.

The common thread: **agent network density is the critical bottleneck**, not technology sophistication. M-SELEN's current 3,000+ agents represent significant progress but remain thin for a population of 740,000 spread across 900+ islands. A market entrant would need to deploy substantially more agents in rural areas while ensuring USSD-based service design for the 58% of mobile users still on feature phones.

## Infrastructure constraints shape viable business models

The Solomon Islands' physical infrastructure imposes hard constraints on payment service design:

**Geography**: 900+ islands with no road networks between them; inter-island travel requires boat, canoe, or small aircraft. Population density is extremely low outside Honiara—75% of the population lives rurally but 70-83% of financial infrastructure concentrates in the capital.

**Electricity**: Only **16% of households** have grid connections. Rural electrification expands via World Bank projects and solar mini-grids, but the practical implication is that feature phones with long battery life—not smartphones requiring daily charging—dominate rural usage.

**Telecommunications**: Our Telekom operates **236 mobile towers** providing nationwide coverage (95% of population, all 9 provinces) including 2G/3G/4G. However, 4G reaches only ~25% of population (primarily Honiara), 3G covers ~20%, and 2G/GSM serves 50%. The Coral Sea Cable System (operational December 2019) provides submarine connectivity to Sydney via PNG, but only 4 of ~300 inhabited islands connect via cable—the rest depend on satellite or microwave. **32.2% internet penetration** (~230,500 users) and **42% smartphone penetration** among mobile users define the addressable market for app-based services.

These constraints indicate viable market entry strategies: **USSD-first service design** ensuring feature phone compatibility, **dense agent networks** providing physical cash-in/cash-out points where digital infrastructure fails, **offline transaction capability** for low-connectivity environments, and potential **solar charging partnerships** enabling device use in off-grid areas.

## Conclusion: Market entry windows and strategic priorities

The Solomon Islands payment ecosystem presents a window of opportunity before market positions solidify. M-SELEN's rapid growth validates demand but its agent network remains thin relative to geographic complexity. Key strategic priorities for a telecom market entrant include:

First, **agent network investment** represents the primary competitive battleground—M-SELEN's 3,000+ agents must be matched or exceeded, with particular focus on rural/outer island presence. Second, **remittance corridor capture** through direct integration with Australian and New Zealand sending services could differentiate a new entrant, given the 8,700+ seasonal workers remitting through high-cost channels. Third, **utility payment integration** with Solomon Power's prepaid meters and Our Telekom's airtime creates recurring transaction volume. Fourth, **CBDC positioning** through early engagement with CBSI on Bokolo Cash integration could establish competitive advantage as the pilot expands.

Regulatory entry appears feasible through the Sandbox Framework, with the National Payment Systems Act 2022 providing statutory foundation. The critical success factors—agent density, feature phone compatibility, and compelling use cases around remittances and bill payments—echo M-Pesa's Kenyan playbook adapted for Pacific island geography. The fundamental market reality: 75% of Solomon Islanders lack bank accounts, but 70% have mobile phones. Closing that gap defines the opportunity.
