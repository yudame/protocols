Strategic Assessment of the Financial Ecosystem and Payment Infrastructure in the Solomon Islands: Implications for Telecommunications Market EntryI. Executive Summary: Strategic Imperatives for Digital Market EntryThe Solomon Islands (SI) presents a nascent but structurally challenging environment for digital financial services (DFS), defined by a deep-seated reliance on cash, extreme geographic centralization of banking infrastructure, and aggressive regulatory mandates for financial inclusion. The retail payments ecosystem remains heavily cash-dominant, accounting for 80% of all transactions in 2020.1 However, this institutional friction creates significant opportunities for a telecommunications (telecom) operator, whose core asset—the nationwide distribution network—directly addresses the structural deficiencies of the traditional banking sector.1.1. Key Findings: Market Viability, Concentration Risk, and Infrastructure GapsThe market is characterized by severe concentration risk, with over 70% of the country’s 59 ATMs located in the capital, Honiara.1 This centralization contributes to the exclusion of 73.3% of the rural population from digital commerce.2 To address this, the Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3) sets clear goals for 2025: increasing active financial accounts to 400,000 and access points to 1,155.3 A telecom entrant’s strategic investment in expanding the agent network is critical, as it aligns perfectly with this national objective.Crucially, existing partnership models, such as the successful YouSave LoMobile micro-pension scheme, validate the regulatory acceptance of using airtime distribution channels for financial services.4 This precedent provides a blueprint for rapid agent conversion. Furthermore, the burgeoning international remittance market, which reached a record SBD 431 million in 2024 5, is burdened by high costs (averaging 11.1%) 6, offering a high-yield opportunity for digital cost arbitrage.1.2. High-Priority Recommendations for Telecom OperatorsPrioritize Remittance and Utility Use Cases: Anchor the mobile money business model in institutional, high-volume flows. Immediately target the SBD 431 million remittance market by offering substantially lower fees than the current 11.1% average.5 Simultaneously, leverage the existing consumer behavior of using mobile top-up for Solomon Power’s Cashpower meters 7 to ensure high-frequency customer retention and immediate wallet activation.Rapid Agent Network Expansion: Commit capital to meet or exceed the NFIS3 target of 1,155 access points.3 The strategy should focus on converting the existing, trusted airtime agent network into regulated cash-in/cash-out (CICO) financial agents, supported by advanced liquidity management technology to prevent rural cash dry-up.Proactive Regulatory Engagement: Utilize the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI)’s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox 8 to test innovative, potentially regional payment solutions (e.g., in anticipation of the Pacific Payments Mechanism).9 Due to the current absence of a finalized regulatory framework for non-bank Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and strict bank licensing requirements (minimum SBD 5 million capital) 10, the immediate operational model should be structured as a partnership with an established commercial bank.II. Foundational Market Dynamics and Economic Context2.1. Socio-Economic Profile and Geographic ConcentrationThe Solomon Islands economy is characterized by a significant geographic disparity in access to formal services. The distribution of banking infrastructure is severely limited and overwhelmingly concentrated in the capital, Honiara.1 The nation's four commercial banks operate only 15 branches nationwide, with an even more pronounced concentration of automated teller machines (ATMs). Of the total 59 ATMs across the country, over 70% are located in Honiara.1This centralization has profound implications for financial inclusion. Data shows that digital economic activity, including usage for social media, communications, and entertainment, is dominated by Honiara residents, who comprise 54.1% to 56.5% of users in these categories.11 Conversely, the rural population faces systemic exclusion. Research indicates that 73.3% of rural residents are excluded from digital commerce due to critical, foundational barriers, including fragmented logistics, absent delivery infrastructure, and a severe lack of payment options.2The extreme centralization of physical banking points suggests that the primary obstacle to widespread financial access is not merely a lack of digital literacy but the inability to securely and efficiently move cash across the islands. Therefore, any viable digital strategy must directly address this liquidity and distribution gap by transforming the telecom’s widely dispersed, non-traditional infrastructure into a secure, regulated financial agent network. The success of a mobile money operation will be directly dependent on its ability to manage the velocity and security of cash flow in these underserved rural communities.Table 1: Geographic Concentration of Financial Access PointsAccess Point TypeTotal NationwideConcentration in HoniaraStrategic ImplicationCommercial Bank Branches15Limited data, presumed highTraditional banking infrastructure is non-viable for mass outreach.ATMs59>70%Digital strategy must decouple cash access from physical bank location (Agent-led CICO).Mobile Money Agents (M-SELEN)250+Focus on nationwide expansionThis network is the crucial channel for meeting NFIS3 access targets outside the capital.2.2. The Predominance of the Cash Economy and Financial FrictionThe reliance on physical currency is deeply embedded in the SI economy. In 2020, cash accounted for a substantial 80% of all transactions.1 Despite the availability of supportive financial infrastructure, the usage of electronic payment methods, such as cards, mobile money wallets, and online banking, remains limited.1While cards are utilized, the volume of card transactions has remained almost stable in recent years, with over 90% of transactions occurring at ATMs primarily for cash withdrawal.1 The average value of an ATM transaction (SBD 542) is relatively close to the average EFTPOS transaction value (SBD 860 in 2022).1 This data suggests that EFTPOS systems have failed to penetrate the high-frequency, low-value retail market that characterizes daily consumer spending. The market demonstrates significant behavioral inertia and resistance to traditional card systems, likely due to high merchant acquisition costs, consumer unfamiliarity, or terminal reliability issues.To effectively introduce digital finance, the strategy must avoid replicating the high-cost card ecosystem. Instead, the entry must leverage existing high mobile penetration (66% of the population have mobile connections) 2 to rapidly deploy lower-cost interfaces such as USSD or Quick Response (QR) codes. These solutions bypass the need for expensive dedicated EFTPOS hardware, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for micro- and small-scale merchants.2.3. The Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3): A Regulatory Mandate for Digital GrowthThe strategic direction of the Solomon Islands financial sector is guided by the Third National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS3), set by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI). NFIS3, premised on the G20 Principles for Innovative Financial Inclusion, sets aggressive, measurable goals to be achieved by 2025.3Key national targets include increasing active users of financial accounts from a baseline of 283,954 to 400,000, with a specific focus on gender equity, requiring 50% of the new user base to be women. Furthermore, the strategy mandates a significant expansion of physical access points nationwide, from 825 to 1,155.3 The stated strategic objectives explicitly amplify the need to increase the reach and quality of digital financial services, and specifically include women, youth, and rural adults as fully engaged participants.3This government-mandated roadmap, developed in consultation with key public and private entities, including the World Bank Group 13, provides a crucial framework for any telecom market entrant. The explicit targets for increasing both the user base and the number of access points create a clear path for collaboration. Any private sector investment, particularly from a telecom, that demonstrably contributes to achieving the goal of 1,155 access points will gain significant regulatory alignment, potentially leading to preferential treatment, access to public development funding, and reduced regulatory friction during complex licensing and operational scaling phases. Regulatory alignment is thus a fundamental source of competitive advantage in the SI market.III. Payment System Infrastructure and Modernization3.1. Central Bank Modernization: The Solomons Automated Transfer System (SOLATS)Recognizing the need to modernize its outdated payment systems, the CBSI launched the Solomons Automated Transfer System (SOLATS) in April 2024.14 SOLATS functions as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payment system, a significant step toward improving efficiency and strengthening security within the national financial infrastructure. This modernization effort is intended to support the digitalization of the economy and drive inclusive, sustainable economic development.14The development of SOLATS received technical expertise and financial support from the World Bank Group, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the governments of Australia and New Zealand. This follows similar payment transformations implemented by central banks in other Pacific nations, including Fiji, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu.14The launch of SOLATS is the critical foundational step required for the scalability and reliability of mobile money operations. Prior to SOLATS, manual cheque clearing was common for interbank payments, leading to delays and settlement risks.1 The RTGS mechanism eliminates these settlement delays and ensures secure, efficient movement of funds between commercial banks and the segregated accounts maintained by mobile money providers. This reduces the systemic liquidity risk for providers and agents alike, making high-volume, high-frequency digital transactions feasible. Compliance with the CBSI National Payment System (SOLATS) is therefore a non-negotiable requirement for any prospective financial institution or banking system partner.103.2. The Interoperability Barrier and Regulatory Push for a National SwitchDespite the technological advancements of SOLATS, the retail payments ecosystem faces several cross-cutting challenges that constrain digital adoption, including limited infrastructure, identification barriers, heavy cash reliance, and significant regulatory gaps.1 A core technical friction point is the current absence of interoperability among providers. Although mobile money wallets have been introduced, they have few active users and currently lack the ability to transact across providers.1The fragmentation caused by the lack of interoperability severely limits the utility of digital wallets, hindering network effects essential for mass adoption. To resolve this, a key focus action identified by market analysis is the implementation of a fully interoperable digital payments infrastructure, potentially through an optimal centralized model.1 Regulators and the Central Bank are currently evaluating the most effective approach—whether market-led, regulator-guided, or regulator-led—to establish a national switch with unified rules and standards.1The CBSI’s current assessment phase presents a strategic opportunity for a telecom entrant to influence the future market structure. By initiating proactive and constructive engagement with CBSI during the national switch design phase, the telecom can contribute technical expertise and commit to immediate integration using standardized protocols (e.g., open APIs). This participation can help steer the technical and commercial standards of the national switch, ensuring the final framework is technically and commercially optimized for the telecom’s platform, thus minimizing potentially costly, reactive technical compliance adjustments later.IV. The Mobile Financial Services Ecosystem: Blueprints for Success4.1. Analysis of Existing Mobile Money Models (M-SELEN and YouSave)Current digital payment solutions, though nascent, offer vital lessons and regulatory precedents for market entry.M-SELENM-SELEN represents a general mobile money service that has onboarded more than 20,000 users and established an agent network of over 250 agents nationwide.15 The service emphasizes cash-in, cash-out (CICO), person-to-person (P2P) transfers, and has recently expanded to include utility bill payments and merchant payments for retail use.15 A critical focus for the platform is the continuous development of a reliable agent network to ensure service availability and accessibility across the country, a recognition of the geographic challenges present in the islands.15YouSave LoMobileThe YouSave LoMobile service, managed by the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SINPF), is arguably the most strategically important case study for a telecom entrant. Launched in 2017, this micropension product successfully targets the informal sector by uniquely leveraging airtime deposits for savings.16 This service is a culmination of a successful public-private partnership involving the SINPF, Solomon Telekom, Bmobile, CBSI, and the Solomon Islands Government (SIG), supported by UNCDF funding.4 The mechanism allows deposits ranging from a minimum of SBD 10 to a maximum of SBD 1,000 per transaction, done simply by dialing a USSD code and confirming the amount from a pre-paid airtime balance.17The YouSave LoMobile model is the single most important proof of concept for the telecom sector. It provides irrefutable validation that the CBSI and SIG are willing to accept the telecom’s existing airtime distribution infrastructure—the most extensive distribution network in the country—as a legitimate and regulated financial conduit. This success establishes a clear blueprint for the rapid conversion of existing airtime top-up agents into regulated CICO financial agents for general mobile money services, allowing a swift scaling operation without the need to build a new network from scratch.4.2. Viability Constraints and Lessons from the Pacific RegionWhile the potential for digital finance is high, market viability in the Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) presents unique challenges that must be addressed proactively. A decade of data from the region shows that, with the notable exception of M-PAiSA in Fiji, many early Digital Financial Services (DFS) models have either downscaled significantly or discontinued operations entirely after initial periods of success.18This historical pattern is largely attributed to the small population sizes of island nations, which make it difficult to achieve the high transaction volumes typically required for a sustainable, profitable mobile money business model.18 Furthermore, PICs face high operational costs related to technology development, staff training, and maintaining resilient infrastructure across dispersed geographies.19A mobile money operation in the Solomon Islands cannot rely solely on low-margin P2P transactions to generate adequate revenue. To ensure long-term commercial sustainability, the business model must be structurally anchored in capturing the transactional value of high-volume, high-value, guaranteed institutional payments. Strategic focus should be placed on capturing flows such as international remittances, Government-to-Person (G2P) payments, and utility collections, which generate the necessary revenue velocity to offset the high operating expenses inherent in geographically fragmented island nations. The underlying technology infrastructure must also be designed for stability, security, and consistent availability.19V. Strategic Payment Use Cases for Market PenetrationThe strategy for market entry must be centered on capturing specific payment flows where cash friction is highest and digital alternatives provide the most pronounced cost and convenience advantage.5.1. Remittance Flows: A High-Yield OpportunityRemittances represent the single most immediate and lucrative target for a digital payment system. Driven significantly by Solomon Islanders participating in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme, international remittances reached a record-breaking SBD 431 million in 2024, representing an increase of more than 70% from the previous year.5 These flows are critical to the national economy and individual welfare, with funds typically used by families for school fees, housing construction, and starting new businesses.5Despite the critical importance of these funds, the cost of formal transfers is exorbitant. The average cost of sending USD 200 to the Solomon Islands currently stands at 11.1%, which is four times higher than the global average cost of 6.35%.6 This high transaction cost represents an immense friction point and, consequently, a massive opportunity for cost arbitrage through digital services.A low-cost, mobile-to-wallet remittance solution can instantly capture market share by targeting a competitive fee structure (e.g., 5-6%). Furthermore, capturing the international flow naturally drives the volume of domestic transfers, which currently operate highly inefficiently. Domestic remittances are 72% cash-based, with only 28% utilizing formal channels.6 Formalizing this 72% cash flow through P2P mobile transfer capabilities will generate substantial, high-volume revenue from internal transactions, driving utilization and enhancing security for users currently relying on risky physical cash transfer methods.5.2. Utility and Bill Payments AggregationUtility payments provide the essential high-frequency use case necessary for retaining active wallet users. Solomon Power, the national electricity provider, utilizes both post-paid (kW meter) and pre-paid (Cashpower) metering systems.7Crucially, the purchase of electricity tokens for Cashpower meters is already supported via mobile top-up 24/7, offering a highly convenient and economical means of managing power usage.7 This existing behavior validates the market's willingness to use the mobile device as the primary interface for essential service payments. Solomon Water, the national water service provider, also supports payments through direct deposits or online banking via ANZ, Bank South Pacific (BSP), and BRED Bank.20 Existing mobile money providers, such as M-SELEN, have already introduced utility bill payment capabilities.15The strategic priority for the telecom entrant must be to integrate Cashpower token generation seamlessly and directly into its mobile wallet platform. This integration should offer superior functionality and convenience compared to basic mobile top-up, positioning the mobile wallet as the definitive 24/7 payment mechanism for the majority of the population. This use case guarantees a high frequency of transactions, crucial for establishing habitual wallet usage and ensuring high customer retention rates, serving as a powerful counterpoint to the traditional, time-consuming counter payments required by Solomon Power for post-paid services.21Table 2: Analysis of Payment Friction and Digital OpportunityUse CaseCurrent StateFriction/CostTelecom OpportunityInternational RemittancesRecord SBD 431M (2024), High Growth 5Average cost: 11.1% 6Low-cost, mobile-to-wallet service; significant arbitrage potential and capturing PALM scheme flows.Domestic Remittances72% done in physical cash 6High security risk, lack of traceability.P2P mobile transfer replacing cash flows; drives agent CICO volume and network utility.Utility Payments (Cashpower)Via mobile top-up already established 7Inefficient integration, limited functionality across utility providers.Seamless 24/7 mobile wallet integration for high-frequency use and customer retention.Retail/E-commerceExcluded 73.3% of rural population 2Lack of payment/logistics infrastructure.Merchant payment solutions (QR/USSD) and strategic logistics partnership.5.3. E-commerce and Retail PaymentsThe potential for e-commerce remains largely untapped, constrained by systemic issues that transcend payment technology alone. The National E-commerce Strategy 2022-2027 identifies logistics, payments, and rural-urban integration as critical barriers, keeping 73.3% of the rural population excluded from digital commerce.2 Successful local initiatives, such as the start-up Toro, have acknowledged the need for simultaneous solutions encompassing a marketplace, payment solutions, and delivery networks.2For a telecom entrant, focusing solely on rolling out merchant payment solutions (e.g., QR/USSD) will not generate sufficient transaction volume unless the underlying logistical and market integration challenges are resolved. A holistic approach is required. The introduction of merchant payments is necessary 15, but this must be paired with strategic partnerships with established or emerging local e-commerce and logistics providers, such as Toro.2 Co-developing payment rails that accommodate the fragmented delivery infrastructure will ensure that digital payments are viable endpoints for transactions, allowing the telecom to capture payment volume and accelerate the inclusion of the currently excluded rural majority.VI. Regulatory Framework and Innovation Pathways6.1. CBSI Licensing and Regulatory GapsThe regulatory landscape is in a transitional phase, marked by stringent traditional banking requirements juxtaposed with acknowledged gaps regarding non-bank Payment Service Providers (PSPs). Licensing for banking institutions, for instance, mandates a minimum paid-up capital or assigned capital of SBD 5 million for a subsidiary or branch operation.10 Furthermore, applicants must demonstrate systems compatibility with the new CBSI National Payment System (SOLATS).10While NFIS3 strongly supports digital finance, the official framework for licensing and overseeing non-bank PSPs offering mobile money services is still evolving. Regulatory gaps have been identified as a constraint on the adoption of digital payment methods.1To mitigate the risk associated with an uncertain non-bank PSP framework, the recommended market entry structure involves an initial bank-led partnership model. Under this approach, the mobile money service operates as a licensed agent or technical provider to an existing commercial bank (e.g., BSP or ANZ), allowing the telecom to leverage the bank's established regulatory compliance, including immediate compatibility with SOLATS, while the CBSI works to finalize a dedicated, perhaps tiered, framework for non-bank entities. This approach minimizes regulatory friction during the crucial scaling phase.6.2. The CBSI FinTech Regulatory SandboxThe CBSI offers a FinTech Regulatory Sandbox Framework, which outlines guidelines for admitting and testing proposed product solutions under the close supervision of the Central Bank.8 This framework is specifically designed to enable the controlled testing of new financial products and services.The Sandbox provides a low-risk environment for a telecom entrant to test advanced and potentially disruptive features that could create a competitive advantage. This is particularly relevant given the regional conversation regarding new financial technologies. For instance, testing advanced cross-border payment protocols or exploring the potential role of digital assets and stablecoins—a topic gaining traction in the Pacific due to their potential to substitute for contracting traditional banking networks 22—can be safely executed within the Sandbox.8 By testing innovative solutions here, the telecom can not only gain first-mover operational experience but also proactively contribute data and expertise to CBSI’s policy formulation, positioning itself as a leader in digital innovation while strictly maintaining adherence to controlled supervision.6.3. Regional Payment System EvolutionThe movement toward regional economic integration is placing increasing pressure on high payment costs. Across the Pacific Islands, the contraction of traditional banking networks is driving governments and institutions to explore digital payment systems as a necessary substitute.22In response to the extremely high transaction costs, which currently afflict the Solomon Islands (11.1% average remittance cost) 6, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat is actively advancing a project that includes a Feasibility Study for a Pacific Payments Mechanism (PPM).9 This mechanism is intended to serve as a regional payment aggregation platform aimed at improving economies of scale, reducing costs, and strengthening cross-border connectivity among Pacific markets.9The high-volume international remittance opportunity (SBD 431 million) 5 is directly tied to the outcome of this regional initiative. The telecom’s long-term remittance strategy must be future-proofed by ensuring its technological platform is capable of integrating with or facilitating standardized regional transfers, such as the proposed PPM. Investing in a system architecture that anticipates and accommodates regional interoperability will ensure that the platform remains cost-competitive and scalable as PALM scheme flows and regional digital trade continue to grow.VII. Strategic Recommendations for Telecom Market Entry (The Action Plan)The following action plan translates the ecosystem analysis into specific, sequential strategic imperatives for a telecommunications operator entering the Solomon Islands DFS market.7.1. Agent Network and Liquidity Management StrategyThe agent network is the operational bottleneck for financial inclusion and must be prioritized over all other infrastructural concerns.7.1.1. Strategic Conversion and NFIS3 ComplianceThe telecom must commit significant capital immediately to meet the National Financial Inclusion Strategy’s access target, committing to the expansion of access points from the current number to 1,155 by 2025.3 This is best achieved through a strategy of conversion over creation. The most efficient pathway involves leveraging the validated success of the YouSave LoMobile model 4 by rapidly converting thousands of existing, trusted airtime and mobile top-up agents into regulated CICO agents under the mobile money license (secured via a bank partner). This conversion significantly accelerates network reach and immediately addresses the structural geographic concentration risk.17.1.2. Critical Investment in Liquidity TechnologyTo prevent operational failure, the telecom must invest heavily in robust, predictive data systems for cash flow and float management. Historically, the failure of DFS in small island nations has often been attributed to agents running out of cash float in rural areas (agent 'dry-up'), crippling service availability.18 The liquidity system must use transactional data and geographic mapping to anticipate cash demand spikes and efficiently manage the logistics of replenishing agent floats, thereby ensuring service resilience and consumer trust outside Honiara.7.2. Product Development and Revenue RoadmapsThe product roadmap must focus on institutional flows to guarantee viability in the small market environment.7.2.1. Product A: Low-Cost Remittance Corridor (Revenue Anchor)The primary revenue focus must be capturing the SBD 431 million international remittance flow.5 This requires establishing a competitive advantage by offering transaction costs that significantly undercut the prevailing 11.1% average.6 The telecom should establish robust connections with major international Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) and target PALM scheme workers in Australia. Simultaneously, the platform must facilitate secure, low-cost domestic P2P transfers to formalize the 72% of domestic remittances currently conducted in cash.67.2.2. Product B: Utility Aggregator (Retention Driver)A deep, seamless integration with utility providers is mandatory for customer retention. The telecom must secure direct integration with Solomon Power, allowing customers to purchase Cashpower tokens 24/7 directly through the mobile wallet interface, replacing the current, less functional mobile top-up process.7 Integration with Solomon Water and other recurring billers (e.g., insurance, school fees) must be secured to establish the mobile wallet as the default mechanism for household financial management.7.2.3. Product C: G2P/P2G Payments (Regulatory Enabler)To position the telecom as a critical national partner, partnerships should be established with Government agencies and state-owned enterprises. Building on the YouSave model 4, the platform should facilitate G2P payments (e.g., benefits, disaster relief), Person-to-Government (P2G) payments (e.g., taxes, fees), and government salary disbursements. This integration strengthens regulatory ties, increases the volume of "sticky" funds within the mobile ecosystem, and reinforces the telecom’s role in advancing national fiscal efficiency.7.3. Interoperability and Regulatory Alignment Strategy7.3.1. Proactive Engagement and National Switch InfluenceGiven the CBSI’s acknowledged need for interoperability and its assessment of national switch models 1, the telecom must proactively engage the Central Bank. A specialized team should be assigned to provide technical input on the design and regulatory requirements of the future National Switch. This engagement seeks to influence the architectural standards of the switch, ensuring the final design minimizes future integration costs and leverages the telecom’s technological capabilities.7.3.2. Structural Compliance ModelTo address current regulatory ambiguity regarding non-bank PSPs 1, the entry structure must initially be built upon a secure, bank-partnered model. This structure ensures immediate compliance with CBSI regulatory expectations, including the mandatory integration standards of SOLATS.10 Once the non-bank PSP framework matures, the telecom can transition towards greater operational independence, potentially utilizing the Regulatory Sandbox 8 to test novel, non-traditional services outside the existing banking parameters.7.4. Strategic Partnership and Ecosystem DevelopmentSuccessful scaling requires comprehensive partnerships that mitigate geographic and logistical deficiencies.Banking Partnerships: Secure formalized partnership agreements with at least two of the commercial banks (e.g., BSP, ANZ, BRED) for custodial accounts, seamless float management, and integration with the SOLATS RTGS system.14E-commerce/Logistics Alliances: Partner with emerging local e-commerce leaders, such as Toro 2, and logistics providers. The aim is to co-develop integrated digital payment and delivery solutions, which is essential to address the fragmentation barriers that exclude the 73.3% of the rural population from digital commerce.2VIII. ConclusionThe Solomon Islands financial ecosystem presents a unique dichotomy: pervasive market friction and infrastructure deficit coexisting with strong regulatory urgency for digital inclusion. The dominance of cash (80% of transactions) 1 and the immense cost of remittances (11.1%) 6 provide the economic rationale for digital disruption. The political and regulatory framework, embodied by NFIS3’s explicit targets 3 and the proven success of the airtime-linked YouSave model 4, provides the necessary roadmap and precedent for a telecom-led market entry.Success for a telecom entrant is predicated on a commitment to solving the core distributional challenge by aggressively scaling a regulated agent network, aligning with the NFIS3 targets. The strategy must be anchored in high-velocity, high-yield institutional use cases—specifically, capturing the booming international remittance flow (SBD 431 million) 5 and dominating the high-frequency utility payment market through integration with Solomon Power Cashpower.7 By adopting a bank-partnered structure initially and leveraging the CBSI Regulatory Sandbox for future innovations, the telecom can navigate regulatory uncertainty while establishing market dominance, driving meaningful financial inclusion, and securing long-term commercial viability in the Pacific market.

## Research from Claude

# Financial ecosystem and payment infrastructure in the Solomon Islands

The Solomon Islands presents a **largely untapped financial market** where 75% of the population lacks bank accounts, yet mobile phone penetration reaches 70%—a gap that represents significant opportunity for telecom-led payment services. Since June 2023, the mobile money service M-SELEN has grown from zero to **350,000 users**, demonstrating powerful latent demand for digital financial services in this archipelago of 900+ islands. For a telecom market entrant, the critical insight is that success depends not on sophisticated technology but on agent network density, feature-phone compatibility, and integration with the remittance corridor from Australia and New Zealand's seasonal worker programs.

## Cash still dominates despite rapid mobile money growth

The Solomon Islands remains predominantly a **cash economy, with 80% of all transactions conducted in physical currency**. This cash dependency persists despite recent infrastructure investments because banking services cluster in Honiara—the capital holds 70% of bank branches, 83% of ATMs, and 72% of EFTPOS terminals while 75% of the population lives rurally across scattered islands.

Four commercial banks operate in the country: **Bank of South Pacific (BSP)** dominates with 8 branches, 28 ATMs, and the only agency banking presence outside Guadalcanal province. ANZ maintains multiple branches in major locations, while BRED Bank (French cooperative, entered 2016) operates 2 branches and 13 ATMs exclusively in Honiara. Pan Oceanic Bank serves a limited market and doesn't issue cards. The entire nation has just **15 bank branches, 59 ATMs, and 423 EFTPOS terminals** serving approximately 740,000 people.

Financial inclusion statistics reveal the opportunity scale: only **25% of the population owns a bank account**, 34% access any formal financial services, 35% rely on informal moneylenders, and 31% remain completely excluded. Women face a **12% gender gap** in account ownership. The average cost to travel one-way to a financial access point is **US$8.67**, with 30% of customers using boats or canoes.

Mobile money has begun disrupting this landscape. **M-SELEN**, launched by Our Telekom in June 2023 with Australian government and UNCDF support, has achieved remarkable growth—from 20,000 users and 250 agents at launch to **350,000 users and 3,000+ agents by early 2025**. The service works on any phone via USSD code (\*673#), enabling cash-in/out, person-to-person transfers, utility bill payments, merchant payments via QR code, and international remittance receiving through KlickEx partnership. Competing services include **EziPei** (operated by Solomon Post using patented SIM-Skin technology that works across networks) and **IumiCash** (QR-based, smartphone-only, limited adoption).

## Prepaid utilities create natural payment touchpoints

Solomon Islanders' utility payment behaviors offer clear entry points for payment service integration. **Solomon Power** operates predominantly on a **prepaid Cashpower meter system** where customers purchase electricity tokens keyed into meters—mirroring the prepaid airtime model that drives telecom revenue. Post-paid kilowatt meters exist primarily for commercial customers with 15-day payment terms.

Payment channels for electricity include cash over counter at Solomon Power offices, EFTPOS (accepting Visa, MasterCard, JCB, Cirrus, PLUS, UnionPay), BSP Mobile Banking top-ups, and increasingly M-SELEN. Solomon Power maintains presence in Honiara and 9 provincial outstations (Auki, Buala, Gizo, Kirakira, Lata, Malu'u, Noro-Munda, Tulagi). However, **only 14% of the population has electricity access**—87% of installed generation capacity serves Honiara.

**Solomon Water** operates on a post-paid monthly billing model with payments accepted at Customer Care Centres, via BSP Mobile Banking, and through a new mobile application launched in 2025. Service coverage extends to Honiara, Auki, Tulagi, Noro, and Gizo only.

Telecom top-ups represent the highest-frequency payment activity. Both **Our Telekom** (80%+ market share, nationwide coverage) and **bmobile-Vodafone** (~20% share, 4 provinces only) operate on prepaid SIM models with top-ups available through retail agents, M-SELEN, and BSP Mobile Banking. The innovative **YouSave LoMobile** program—a world-first launched in 2019—allows mobile airtime top-ups to convert directly into pension savings through the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, demonstrating how telecom rails can enable financial services beyond payments.

## Seasonal worker remittances represent a high-growth corridor

Remittance flows to the Solomon Islands total approximately **US$85-89 million annually**, representing about 5% of GDP—lower than remittance-dependent neighbors like Tonga (41% of GDP) or Samoa (28%) but growing rapidly due to labor mobility programs. The CBSI reported nearly **SBD$200 million** in remittances from labour mobility programs alone in 2023.

The primary source countries are **Australia** (via the PALM scheme—Pacific Australia Labour Mobility) and **New Zealand** (via the RSE scheme—Recognised Seasonal Employer). As of mid-2024, **7,600+ Solomon Islanders** work under PALM, making Solomon Islands the largest Pacific source country for the program. New Zealand hosts **1,100+ RSE workers**, with the program experiencing its first year exceeding 1,000 workers. Combined, approximately **8,700 seasonal workers** are deployed abroad, with 15,000+ in queue and government targets of 16,000 workers by 2028.

Current remittance channels include:

- **Western Union**: Available through BSP branches and Solomon Islands Post offices for cash pickup, though online sending FROM Solomon Islands is no longer available
- **KlickEx**: New Zealand-based digital platform partnered with M-SELEN for direct mobile wallet transfers, with recipients cashing out at 1,000+ M-SELEN agent outlets
- **Bank transfers**: BSP and ANZ offer international transfers; ANZ charges AUD$7 flat fee for Pacific transfers under AUD$10,000

The critical friction point is **cost**. Pacific remittance corridors rank among the world's most expensive—the Australia-to-Solomon Islands corridor costs an estimated **15-20%** (compared to the global average of 6.49% and the SDG target of 3%). This premium derives from cash-to-cash service dominance (highest overhead), thin competition, compliance costs from bank de-risking, and hidden exchange rate margins layered on top of visible fees.

Last-mile delivery to outer islands remains challenging: limited banking infrastructure, patchy mobile coverage (some areas have 2G only or none), and dependence on physical agents concentrated in population centers. M-SELEN's agent network expansion addresses this gap but coverage remains incomplete.

## The regulatory framework supports innovation while gaps persist

The **Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI)** serves as the primary regulator, with explicit mandate under Section 9(n) of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands Act 2012 to "promote financial inclusion and related activities." The regulatory environment has modernized significantly since 2022 but implementation gaps remain.

Key legislation includes:

- **National Payment Systems Act 2022** (enacted October 2022): Landmark law enabling payment system modernization and CBSI oversight of payment service providers—though the IMF's 2024 Article IV report notes regulations to operationalize this Act remain pending
- **Financial Institutions Act 1998**: Primary licensing framework for banking business, including capital adequacy, asset classification, liquidity management, and large exposure limits
- **Exchange Control Act 1976**: Governs foreign exchange licensing—operating without a license is a serious offense

The **Regulatory Sandbox Framework** launched April 2022 provides a controlled testing environment for fintech innovations including mobile money, payment service providers, remittances, and MSME financing. **ACCountplan** became the first successful sandbox applicant in August 2023, testing a cross-regional remittance application.

The **National Financial Inclusion Strategy 3 (2021-2025)** sets explicit targets: increase individuals with formal financial accounts from 283,000 to 400,000 (50% women) and expand access points from 825 to 1,155. Six strategic objectives emphasize digital financial services, MSME finance, women/youth/rural inclusion, and financial literacy.

On **cryptocurrency**, CBSI has issued clear warnings that cryptocurrencies "do not have any legal tender status" and "strongly discourages the public to invest" due to speculative risks. No regulatory framework governs crypto trading, taxation, or service providers—it exists in a legal gray area (not prohibited but not regulated).

The most significant emerging development is **Bokolo Cash**, a Central Bank Digital Currency proof-of-concept launched November 2023 with Japanese government funding and Soramitsu (the company behind Cambodia's Bakong CBDC) as technical partner. Built on Hyperledger Iroha 2 permissioned blockchain, Bokolo Cash is pegged 1:1 to the Solomon Islands dollar, uses two-tier KYC verification, and is testing retail transactions, wholesale interbank transfers, and simulated cross-border payments via the SORA public blockchain. The CBSI (Amendment) Act 2023 provides legislative foundation for digital currency developments.

## Payment system infrastructure reached a milestone in 2024

The April 2024 launch of **SOLATS (Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System)** represents a fundamental infrastructure upgrade. This real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system—developed with IFC/World Bank technical assistance and Australian/New Zealand funding—replaces manual cheque clearing that previously required 2-3 day settlement. Interbank transfers now process in approximately 10 minutes.

A **Central Securities Depository** linked to SOLATS enables electronic registry for government and central bank securities trading in real time. These systems create the backbone for lower-cost digital payments, faster settlement, and eventual interoperability with regional payment networks.

Regional integration remains nascent but accelerating. Cross-border mobile money links now connect Fiji-Cook Islands (April 2024) and Fiji-Vanuatu (2023). **Digicel's MyCash Pacific Transfers** enables instant transfers between Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Solomon Islands could eventually join this Pacific mobile money network, dramatically reducing remittance costs for diaspora workers.

The upcoming **Comprehensive Credit Reporting Regulations 2025** (effective September 2025) will make Solomon Islands the first Pacific nation with a positive credit reporting regime—expanding data sources to utility records and voter files, potentially enabling credit scoring for the previously unbanked.

## Telecom-led payment success requires agent networks and simplicity

International experience from similar markets reveals success factors for telecom payment services:

**M-Pesa (Kenya)**: The canonical success story grew financial inclusion from 26% (2006) to 84% (2021) with 30.2 million active users. Critical factors included Safaricom's 77% mobile market share at launch providing distribution advantage, an **agent network of 81,025 outlets** forming the operational backbone, simple "send money home" value proposition on basic handsets via SIM toolkit, transparent pricing undercutting bank fees, regulatory flexibility via "test-and-learn" approach, and eventual bank partnerships rather than competition.

**Fiji (M-PAiSA and MyCash)**: Demonstrates Pacific success—632,123 users representing over two-thirds of the population, 316% year-over-year growth in P2P transactions, FJ$83.6 million in e-money circulation. Phase 3 of Fiji's National Payment System now enables direct bank-to-mobile wallet transfers, and cross-border links to Vanuatu and Cook Islands extend utility.

**Papua New Guinea (CellMoni)**: Digicel's service reached 1.6 million individual users (53% of Digicel's customer base). Notably, **EasiPawa**—prepaid electricity via airtime—"blitzed all usage forecasts," demonstrating the power of utility integration. However, Digicel's 91% market share creates near-monopoly conditions limiting competitive dynamics.

The common thread: **agent network density is the critical bottleneck**, not technology sophistication. M-SELEN's current 3,000+ agents represent significant progress but remain thin for a population of 740,000 spread across 900+ islands. A market entrant would need to deploy substantially more agents in rural areas while ensuring USSD-based service design for the 58% of mobile users still on feature phones.

---

## Infrastructure constraints shape viable business models

The Solomon Islands' physical infrastructure imposes hard constraints on payment service design:

**Geography**: 900+ islands with no road networks between them; inter-island travel requires boat, canoe, or small aircraft. Population density is extremely low outside Honiara—75% of the population lives rurally but 70-83% of financial infrastructure concentrates in the capital.

**Electricity**: Only **16% of households** have grid connections. Rural electrification expands via World Bank projects and solar mini-grids, but the practical implication is that feature phones with long battery life—not smartphones requiring daily charging—dominate rural usage.

**Telecommunications**: Our Telekom operates **236 mobile towers** providing nationwide coverage (95% of population, all 9 provinces) including 2G/3G/4G. However, 4G reaches only ~25% of population (primarily Honiara), 3G covers ~20%, and 2G/GSM serves 50%. The Coral Sea Cable System (operational December 2019) provides submarine connectivity to Sydney via PNG, but only 4 of ~300 inhabited islands connect via cable—the rest depend on satellite or microwave. **32.2% internet penetration** (~230,500 users) and **42% smartphone penetration** among mobile users define the addressable market for app-based services.

These constraints indicate viable market entry strategies: **USSD-first service design** ensuring feature phone compatibility, **dense agent networks** providing physical cash-in/cash-out points where digital infrastructure fails, **offline transaction capability** for low-connectivity environments, and potential **solar charging partnerships** enabling device use in off-grid areas.

---

## Conclusion: Market entry windows and strategic priorities

The Solomon Islands payment ecosystem presents a window of opportunity before market positions solidify. M-SELEN's rapid growth validates demand but its agent network remains thin relative to geographic complexity. Key strategic priorities for a telecom market entrant include:

First, **agent network investment** represents the primary competitive battleground—M-SELEN's 3,000+ agents must be matched or exceeded, with particular focus on rural/outer island presence. Second, **remittance corridor capture** through direct integration with Australian and New Zealand sending services could differentiate a new entrant, given the 8,700+ seasonal workers remitting through high-cost channels. Third, **utility payment integration** with Solomon Power's prepaid meters and Our Telekom's airtime creates recurring transaction volume. Fourth, **CBDC positioning** through early engagement with CBSI on Bokolo Cash integration could establish competitive advantage as the pilot expands.

Regulatory entry appears feasible through the Sandbox Framework, with the National Payment Systems Act 2022 providing statutory foundation. The critical success factors—agent density, feature phone compatibility, and compelling use cases around remittances and bill payments—echo M-Pesa's Kenyan playbook adapted for Pacific island geography. The fundamental market reality: 75% of Solomon Islanders lack bank accounts, but 70% have mobile phones. Closing that gap defines the opportunity.

## Research from Perplexity

Now I have gathered comprehensive information. Let me compile this into a detailed research report.

# Financial Ecosystem and Payment Infrastructure in Solomon Islands

The Solomon Islands presents a compelling case study of a Pacific Island nation transitioning from a predominantly cash-based economy toward digital financial inclusion. For telecommunications operators considering market entry, understanding this financial landscape—from traditional payment patterns to emerging digital solutions—is essential for identifying integration opportunities and addressing unmet needs.

## Current Payment Landscape

### Cash Dominance and the Digital Divide

The Solomon Islands remains heavily cash-dependent, with **cash transactions accounting for approximately 80% of all retail payments** as of 2020. This reliance persists despite available financial infrastructure, primarily due to the geographic dispersion of the population across nearly 1,000 islands spanning 1,500 kilometers of ocean, with **approximately 76% of the population residing in rural areas**.[1][2]

The digital economy score for Solomon Islands stands at **39-43%** according to the UNCDF Inclusive Digital Economy Scorecard, placing the country firmly in the "start-up" development stage. Internet penetration reached **42.5% of the population** (352,000 users) by early 2025, while mobile connections totaled **547,000** (equivalent to 66% of the population), with **81.8% of connections capable of broadband speeds**.[3][4]

### Banking Infrastructure and Access Rates

Banking access remains concentrated in urban areas, particularly Honiara:

- **Four commercial banks** operate in the country: Bred Bank, Pan Oceanic Bank (POB), Bank of South Pacific (BSP), and ANZ[2]
- Only **15 bank branches** exist nationwide, with **11 (over 70%) located in Honiara**[1][2]
- **59 ATMs** serve the entire country, with **49 (83%) concentrated in Honiara**[2][1]
- The country has approximately **13.94 ATMs per 100,000 adults**, compared to 50.48 in Fiji and 61.96 in Samoa[2]
- Only **53 mobile money agents** operate nationally, with **44 in rural provinces**[2]

According to the 2015 demand-side survey, **more than 30% of adult Solomon Islanders lack a bank account**. More recent data suggests only **25% of the population owns a bank account**, while **35% rely exclusively on informal financial services** and **31% are completely excluded from financial services**.[5][6][7][8]

### Mobile Money Adoption and Platforms

Three mobile money services currently operate in Solomon Islands:

**M-Selen** (Our Telekom) represents the most significant development. Launched in June 2023 with support from the Australian government and UNCDF, it leverages Our Telekom's dominant market position (**60-80% mobile market share**). Key features include:[9][10]

- Access via any phone type (not limited to smartphones)
- Cash-in/cash-out, P2P transfers, mobile top-ups, balance checks
- Integration with KlickEx for international remittances from Australia and New Zealand (launched October 2024)[11]
- Partnership with **Ria Money Transfer** enabling remittances from **200+ countries** (announced 2025)[12]
- Approximately **50 agents**, with 31 in Honiara[2]

**EziPei** (launched February 2020) and **IumiCash** (launched January 2021) are foreign-owned platforms offering similar services including cash in/out, P2P transfers, airtime top-ups, and merchant payments. EziPei notably enables **prepaid electricity (Cash Power) purchases** for Solomon Power.[13][2]

As of July 2023, approximately **13,400 mobile wallet accounts** existed, but **only 10-15% were active users**. The National Financial Inclusion Strategy targets increasing active financial accounts from 283,954 to **400,000 by 2025**, with 50% being women.[14][15][2]

### Point-of-Sale Systems: Urban versus Rural

The disparity between urban and rural payment infrastructure is stark:

- **423 EFTPOS terminals** nationwide, with **72% (304 terminals) in Honiara**[2]
- **313 EFTPOS merchants**, with **78.5% (246 merchants) in Honiara**[2]
- **96,848 payment cards** in circulation: 41% open-loop Visa cards, 59% closed-loop cards[2]
- Card transactions remain **predominantly ATM withdrawals (over 90%)**, with average ATM transaction value of SBD 542 and EFTPOS transaction value of SBD 860[2]

Rural provinces lack basic financial touchpoints, forcing residents to undertake lengthy, costly journeys to Honiara for banking services.[1][2]

## Utility and Bill Payment Systems

### Solomon Power: Electricity Payments

Solomon Power operates a **dual-meter system** reflecting the country's payment infrastructure evolution:

**Cashpower (Prepaid) Meters** represent the preferred model for residential customers. Electricity is purchased as tokens that are keyed into meters to activate power. This system offers:

- 24/7 mobile top-up capability
- Over-the-counter purchases at Solomon Power locations
- Integration with **EziPei** for digital prepaid electricity purchases[16][17][13]

**Conventional kW Meters (Post-paid)** are primarily used for commercial and industrial premises, requiring monthly billing and payment within 15 days.[16]

Payment channels for Solomon Power include:

- Cash payments at all Solomon Power locations (meter number required)
- Cheque payments (no personal cheques accepted)
- EFTPOS machines (BSP and ANZ) accepting Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Cirrus, UnionPay
- Mobile top-up through EziPei and M-Selen platforms[18][13]

**Electricity access remains limited**: only **76% of the population has electricity access**, with significantly lower rates in rural areas. The **World Bank-funded Solomon Islands Electricity Access and Renewable Energy Expansion Project** uses Output-Based Aid subsidies to connect low-income households, covering service lines, prepaid meters, and in-house wiring.[19][20][21]

### Water and Telecom Services

Payment options for telecom services (Our Telekom and Bmobile) include:

- Prepaid airtime vouchers
- Direct mobile top-up through EziPei and M-Selen
- Bank transfers and over-the-counter payments

The **YouSave lo mobile** initiative enables savings contributions through airtime top-ups, demonstrating integration between telecommunications and financial services.[22]

## Remittance Flows

### Scale and Significance

Remittances have emerged as a **critical economic lifeline** for Solomon Islands:

- **Total remittances reached SBD 475.5 million (approximately USD 55 million) in 2024**, representing a **68% increase** from the previous year[23]
- Remittances now constitute the **third-largest foreign exchange earner** after logging and cocoa exports[23]
- Remittances represent approximately **3.5-5% of GDP** and are projected to reach **4.3% of GDP by 2029**[24][25]
- The growing **Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme** is driving remittance growth, with over **7,600 Solomon Islanders employed in Australia** and **1,100 in New Zealand** as of July 2024[26]

### Remittance Channels and Providers

**Western Union** remains the dominant formal remittance provider, operating through agent locations concentrated in urban centers (Honiara, Auki, Munda). Recipients collect cash in person with valid ID.[27][28][29]

**KlickEx** provides digital transfers directly to **M-Selen mobile wallets**, offering:

- Transfers from Australia and New Zealand
- Multiple priority services with varying speeds and exchange rates
- No transfer fees (margin built into exchange rate)[30][31]

**MoneyGram** operates through BSP branches.[2]

**Ria Money Transfer** partnership with M-Selen (2025) enables remittances from **200+ countries** directly to mobile wallets.[12]

### Costs and Friction Points

Remittance costs to Solomon Islands remain **among the highest globally**:

- Average remittance cost to the Pacific is **9.1%**, compared to the global average of **6.25%** and the UN target of **3%**[32][33]
- Solomon Islands-specific costs reach approximately **11.1%**, roughly **four times the global average**[2]
- High costs result from limited provider competition, geographic challenges, and thin transaction volumes

Key friction points include:

- **Limited agent locations** outside Honiara
- **Identification requirements** (many rural residents lack formal ID)
- **Cash-out challenges** in remote areas
- **Difficulties accessing Australian superannuation** for returning seasonal workers[2]

### Access and Usage of Remittance Funds

Recipients typically access funds through:

- Cash pickup at Western Union/MoneyGram agents (requiring travel to urban centers)
- Direct deposit to M-Selen mobile wallets (via KlickEx or Ria)
- Bank account transfers (for those with banking access)

Households receiving remittances are more likely to **invest in education** and engage in **non-subsistence private activities**, including opening formal financial accounts.[25]

## Income Segments and Financial Behaviors

### Urban Middle and High-Income Residents (Honiara)

Honiara concentrates the country's formal employment and higher-income households:

- **Smartphone penetration** is growing, with the 2019 Census reporting **225,945 people (44.7% of population 12+) owned mobile phones**[34]
- Among mobile phone owners, **only 1.8% (933 people) used mobile banking** as of 2019[34]
- Social media dominates mobile internet usage (66%), followed by communication (62%) and entertainment (51.3%)[34]
- Honiara residents account for **55-56% of all social media and communication usage**[34]

Financial behaviors among urban residents include:

- Greater likelihood of holding bank accounts
- Access to formal credit (though uptake remains low)
- Higher use of EFTPOS and card payments
- Emerging adoption of mobile money services

### Banking Relationships and Preferences

The banking sector shows:

- **Private sector credit grew 5% to SBD 2.9 billion in 2024**[23]
- Non-performing loan ratio of **10.6%** (H1 2024), indicating some credit quality deterioration[25]
- Strong preference for cash transactions even among banked populations
- Limited trust in digital financial services among older demographics

### Rural Financial Behaviors

Rural populations predominantly rely on:

- **Informal savings and lending networks**
- **YouSave** voluntary pension scheme (54% female membership)[35][36]
- **SPBD Microfinance** (over 31,000 microloans disbursed since 2012)[36][35]
- Cash-based subsistence and agricultural trading

## Regulatory Environment

### Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) Oversight

CBSI leads financial inclusion efforts through:

**National Payment Systems Act 2022** provides the legal foundation for:

- Modern payment system infrastructure
- Electronic funds settlement
- Consumer protection frameworks
- Licensing of payment service providers[37][6]

**Solomon Automated Transfer System (SOLATS)**, launched April 2024, is a **real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system** replacing manual cheque clearing:

- Includes Automated Clearing House (ACH) functionality
- Enables instant fund transfers between banks
- Provides foundation for interoperability with mobile money platforms[6][5][23]

### Digital Payments Licensing

**Mobile money services** currently operate under "No Objection" letters from CBSI pending formal regulations. The Payment Systems Act 2022 will enable proper licensing frameworks.[2]

**Regulatory Sandbox** (launched April 2022) provides a controlled testing environment for fintech innovations:

- Open to legitimate businesses incorporated in Solomon Islands or elsewhere
- Focuses on payment services, mobile money, agricultural finance, insurance, and remittances
- MobileFund (SINPF's digital nano-loan product) has been tested through the sandbox[38][39][40]

### Cryptocurrency and Stablecoin Position

CBSI maintains a **cautionary stance on cryptocurrencies**:

- Cryptocurrencies **are not legal tender** in Solomon Islands[41][42][43]
- CBSI warns against cryptocurrency investment as "very risky and speculative"
- Concerns include money laundering, tax evasion, and consumer protection risks[44]

However, the IMF's 2024 report suggests **foreign currency-backed stablecoins could be realistic alternatives** for Pacific nations lacking sovereign currencies, "though only with robust regulation and supervision".[45]

### Bokolo Cash CBDC Pilot

Solomon Islands launched a **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Proof-of-Concept** in November 2023:

- **Bokolo Cash** is a digital representation of the Solomon Dollar built on **Hyperledger Iroha 2** blockchain
- Developed in partnership with Japanese fintech **Soramitsu** and funded by the Japanese government
- Each Bokolo equals SBD 1 and functions as legal tender within the pilot
- Accepted at selected merchants in Honiara with two-tier KYC verification
- Tests both retail and wholesale CBDC use cases, including simulated international remittances[46][47][48]

Prime Minister Sogavare positioned the initiative as advancing "inclusive and sustainable development" and reducing financial exclusion for the underserved and unbanked.[49][50]

## Emerging and Potential Payment Solutions

### Regional Payment Integration

The **Pacific Strengthening Correspondent Banking Relationships Project** (US$77 million across 8 countries) addresses declining correspondent banking access:

- Solomon Islands experienced a **57% reduction in correspondent banking services** between 2011 and 2022[24]
- The project includes a **feasibility study for a Pacific Payments Mechanism** designed to reduce costs and improve reliability of cross-border payments[51][24]
- Participating countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu) each committed US$9 million[51]

### Stablecoin Possibilities

While CBSI has not endorsed stablecoins, several factors suggest potential future relevance:

- The IMF's analysis indicates **foreign currency-denominated stablecoins** could benefit Pacific nations with limited oversight capacity[45]
- Regional examples include Singapore's stablecoin framework, Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill (effective August 2025), and Japan's Payment Services Act for bank-issued stablecoins[52][53]
- **On/off-ramp services** do not currently exist domestically, though M-Selen's integration with KlickEx provides some cross-border digital transfer capability[30][11]

### Telecom-Led Payment Success Models

International precedents demonstrate the transformative potential of telecom-led mobile money:

**M-PESA (Kenya)** remains the gold standard:

- Launched 2007 by Safaricom (Vodafone)
- Reached **65% of Kenyan adults** within five years
- Processes more domestic transactions than Western Union does globally
- Agent network grew from 300 to **nearly 30,000**
- Success factors: management of agent networks, simple SMS-based transfers, addressing genuine need (sending money home)[54][55][56][57]

**GCash (Philippines)** and **Easypaisa (Pakistan)** demonstrate similar telecom-mobile money integration potential in emerging markets.[58]

Key lessons for Solomon Islands:

- Dominant telecom position (Our Telekom's 60-80% market share) mirrors M-PESA's launch conditions
- Agent network development is critical for rural reach
- Use cases must address genuine local needs (remittances, utility payments, agricultural income)
- Interoperability with formal banking accelerates adoption

## Infrastructure Constraints and Opportunities

### Connectivity Challenges

- **Internet penetration: 42.5%** (352,000 users)[3]
- **Mobile connections: 547,000** (66% of population)[3]
- Only **25% of population covered by 4G**, 20% by 3G, 50% by 2G[4]
- **75% of Solomon Islanders live in regions with limited or outdated connectivity**[4]

**Submarine cable**: A single fiber optic cable (launched December 2019) connects only 4 inhabited islands; remaining 343 rely on satellite or microwave. The cable's fragility was demonstrated in May 2023 when an accidental anchor drop caused major outages.[2]

**Mobile tower expansion**: The government's **Solomon Islands National Broadband Infrastructure Project** targets 161 additional towers, with 48% scheduled for completion before November 2023.[2]

### Electricity Access

- **76% overall electricity access rate**[21]
- Urban areas: approximately **73%**; rural areas: approximately **60%**[59]
- High electricity costs (**over USD 0.60 per kWh**—among the world's highest) due to diesel import dependence[60]
- **Solar expansion projects** (ADB-funded $20.6 million initiative) targeting rural electrification[61][60]

### Identification Gaps

- **Only 30% of the population has birth certificates**[2]
- No national ID system exists; identification relies on passports, voter IDs, birth certificates, or letters from village heads
- **SIM card registration** is being mandated to build a digital identity database[2]
- Lack of national physical addressing system hampers e-commerce development

## Opportunities for Telecommunications-Led Financial Services

### Identified Gaps and Market Opportunities

**Rural financial access**: 70% of the population lives in rural areas without formal financial services. Mobile money can leapfrog physical infrastructure requirements.[35][36]

**Remittance integration**: The explosive growth in seasonal worker remittances (68% increase in 2024) creates demand for efficient, low-cost digital channels. M-Selen's KlickEx and Ria partnerships demonstrate this opportunity.[23]

**Utility payments**: Integration with Solomon Power's prepaid electricity system (already operational through EziPei) provides daily use cases driving adoption.

**Government payments**: Digitizing government-to-person (G2P) payments (salaries, benefits, disaster relief) could dramatically accelerate financial inclusion and create sustainable transaction volumes.[2]

**Savings and credit products**: MobileFund's success in the regulatory sandbox demonstrates demand for digital nano-credit linked to savings schemes like YouSave.[38]

**Interoperability imperative**: CBSI Governor Dr. Luke Forau has explicitly called for "interoperability of the payments systems with other digital financial services such as M-Selen, Iumi-Cash, Ezipei" to extend services to "the last mile".[23]

### Strategic Considerations for Market Entry

A telecommunications operator entering the Solomon Islands financial services market should consider:

**Regulatory pathway**: Engage early with CBSI's Financial Systems Regulations Department; utilize the regulatory sandbox for product testing; plan for formal licensing under the Payment Systems Act 2022.

**Agent network development**: Success requires extensive agent networks in rural areas. Our Telekom's existing retail network provides competitive advantage; new entrants would need partnerships or significant investment in distribution.

**Use case prioritization**: Focus initially on high-frequency needs—airtime top-ups, prepaid electricity, P2P transfers, remittance receipt—before expanding to savings, credit, and merchant payments.

**Infrastructure resilience**: Design for intermittent connectivity; USSD-based services remain important given limited smartphone penetration (M-Selen works on any phone type).

**Partnership ecosystem**: Collaboration with SINPF (YouSave integration), commercial banks (SOLATS connectivity), utility providers (Solomon Power), and international remittance networks will determine success.

The Solomon Islands financial ecosystem, while underdeveloped by global standards, presents significant opportunities for operators willing to navigate infrastructure constraints and regulatory requirements. The confluence of government policy support, growing remittance flows, expanding mobile connectivity, and demonstrated demand for digital financial services creates favorable conditions for telecom-led financial inclusion initiatives.

Financial Ecosystem and Payment Infrastructure in the Solomon Islands

The Solomon Islands’ financial system is undergoing a gradual evolution from a predominantly cash-based economy toward greater use of digital payments. This transformation is influenced by limited banking infrastructure, new mobile money services, and supportive regulatory initiatives. Below is a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, spanning traditional cash usage to emerging digital solutions, with notes on urban–rural disparities and parallels to neighboring Papua New Guinea.

Current Payment Landscape

Cash remains king: The Solomon Islands is still largely a cash economy. As recently as 2020, an estimated 80% of all retail transactions were conducted in cash ￼. Even those with bank accounts frequently withdraw their funds as cash – over 90% of card transactions occur at ATMs (mostly for cash withdrawals) rather than at merchant point-of-sale terminals ￼. This reliance on cash is driven by necessity: outside the capital Honiara, access to banks or digital payment points is very limited.

Limited banking access: Only about one-quarter of adult Solomon Islanders have an account with a formal financial institution. A 2015 survey found that roughly 26% of adults had a bank account, with another 8% using other formal services (like credit unions or microfinance), and 35% relying on informal mechanisms – leaving around 31% completely excluded from financial services ￼. In absolute terms, as of March 2020 there were about 150,000 active bank account users nationwide ￼. The country has only four commercial banks, operating 15 branches and 59 ATMs in total, over 70% of which are in Honiara ￼. This urban concentration means rural communities (the majority of the population) often have no local bank branch or ATM. It can take many hours by boat or road for rural residents to reach banking services, contributing to low usage. For context, Solomon Islands had about 1.27 ATMs per 10,000 adults, far lower than Fiji’s 4.64 ￼ ￼. The average time to reach a bank agent in rural areas is nearly 70 minutes (versus ~22 minutes in Fiji) ￼ ￼. These barriers help explain why cash in hand is the default for most transactions.

Mobile phone ubiquity, but digital payments nascent: On the positive side, mobile telephony is widespread – by 2014, an estimated 93% of households had at least one mobile phone ￼. This provided a platform for mobile banking and wallet services to grow. However, until recently, true mobile money adoption was minimal. Internet connectivity remains a challenge (only ~28% of the population had internet access in 2020 ￼, with even fewer enjoying reliable 3G/4G coverage outside main towns), so advanced app-based services have been slow to penetrate. Early initiatives focused on SMS/USSD solutions. For example, the National Provident Fund introduced a service called youSave LoMobile that allowed informal sector workers to deposit savings via mobile top-up vouchers ￼ ￼. Such programs contributed to a relatively high uptake of basic mobile financial services by regional standards – by 2016, about 40% of adults in Solomon Islands had used some form of mobile banking or mobile wallet, far ahead of neighboring Pacific countries ￼ ￼. This figure likely includes users of simple GSM mobile banking provided by banks (e.g. balance checks or transfers via USSD) and NPF’s mobile savings product. It suggested an appetite for mobile-based finance even before any full-fledged e-wallet existed.

New mobile money services: The watershed came in mid-2023 with the launch of M-SELEN, the country’s first true mobile money platform, by the largest telco Our Telekom (with support from UNCDF and Australia). “M-selen” – meaning “mobile money” in local Pijin ( selen means money) – gained rapid uptake, reaching over 350,000 registered customers by August 2025 ￼. This is an enormous number (roughly half the population), illustrating the latent demand for financial services. The platform also built an agent network 3,000+ strong in two years ￼, extending into remote villages. Through M-SELEN, users can deposit cash, withdraw, transfer funds, buy mobile airtime, and (soon) pay for goods and services via their phone ￼ ￼. Early indicators show strong rural adoption: people value the ability to send money instantly to family in distant provinces, avoiding costly travel ￼ ￼. Trust in the provider has been key – Our Telekom is a well-known local brand (majority-owned by the national provident fund) and this familiarity helped encourage people to try the wallet ￼. The service addresses a real gap, given that only 25% of Solomon Islanders have bank accounts and 31% had no access to formal or informal finance as of recent years ￼. By putting basic financial tools “in the palm of their hand,” mobile money is beginning to bridge that divide.

Other digital payment players: In addition to M-SELEN, there are a few smaller e-money platforms:
• EziPei: An e-wallet launched by Solomon Post in 2019. EziPei enables services like mobile airtime top-ups and prepaid electricity purchase online ￼ ￼. Solomon Post acts as an agent network for this service (selling digital top-up coupons for power, etc.). While EziPei offered a useful solution for prepaid utilities, its adoption has been relatively modest compared to M-SELEN’s recent boom. It remains one of the licensed mobile wallet providers, but without interoperability, users of EziPei can only transact within that system.
• IumiCash: A private fintech startup providing a smartphone-based e-wallet (“iumi” meaning “us” in Pijin). IumiCash was admitted to the Central Bank’s regulatory sandbox and by 2023 was granted a Money Transfer Operator license ￼. It allows person-to-person transfers via a mobile app and targets the “unbanked” youth segment. Some local businesses (like cafes) have started accepting payments via IumiCash QR code or app ￼ ￼. However, IumiCash is still in early stages; like EziPei, it operates a closed-loop system and must build up its user base.
• Bank mobile banking apps: All four banks offer some form of mobile banking or payment app. For example, BSP’s Mobile Banking (accessible via USSD *131# on Telekom or *134# on bmobile) lets its customers transfer funds, pay certain bills, and buy top-ups from a basic phone ￼. BRED Bank has an app (“Solomon Connect”) that supports QR payments and bill pay ￼. ANZ historically offered goMoney in the Pacific, and Pan Oceanic Bank (POB) had card services but no mobile wallet. These bank-centric services serve the salaried, banked population in Honiara. Uptake has been limited by the low overall banked population, but they provide important digital options for urban clients (e.g. online bill pay or account transfers) and complement the new mobile wallets.

Overall, cash versus digital is still lopsided in favor of cash, especially outside urban centers. But the trajectory from 2023 onward is toward rapid digitization, led by telecom-driven mobile money. The Solomon Islands’ experience is similar to Papua New Guinea in that respect: PNG likewise saw very slow uptake of digital finance for years until a major telecom (Digicel) launched a wallet and leveraged its agent network to reach the masses. In both countries, cultural trust and access points are crucial – people need to physically see agents or trusted retailers handling the e-money before they believe in it. Thanks to an expansive agent rollout, Solomon Islanders are beginning to use their phones for everyday transactions that previously were only done in cash.

Utility and Bill Payment Systems

Paying for basic services like electricity, water, and telecommunications in the Solomon Islands has traditionally required in-person cash payments, but this is starting to change with the advent of mobile payment options. There is a mix of prepaid (“cashpower”) systems and postpaid billing, with payment channels evolving differently for each utility:
• Electricity (Solomon Power): Many households are on prepaid electricity meters, locally known as “Cashpower.” Customers buy electricity credit (tokens) and load their meter. Historically, this meant going to a Solomon Power office or authorized vendor with cash. Solomon Power’s payment guidelines list “cash payment over the counter” as the primary method, with customers required to bring their meter number to the office ￼. Cheques were accepted for businesses (no personal cheques), and the power company’s offices in Honiara even have EFTPOS machines to accept bank cards (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) ￼. However, access to those card facilities is limited to urban centers. In practice, most people simply paid cash at Solomon Power cashiers or a few retail outlets selling power coupons.
Emergence of prepaid top-up by mobile: To make buying power more convenient, Solomon Power and partners have introduced mobile-enabled top-ups. Solomon Post’s EziPei platform is one such channel – it is authorized to sell prepaid electricity coupons through its network of retail outlets and via the EziPei mobile interface ￼. With EziPei, a user can log in, ensure their e-wallet has balance, and purchase an electricity token by entering their meter number and desired amount, receiving the token via SMS ￼ ￼. More recently, Our Telekom integrated electricity payments into M-SELEN. Through the M-SELEN app or USSD menu, customers can select “Pay Bills” and then buy Solomon Power prepaid credit by entering their meter ID and amount ￼. A confirmation text provides the token, which the customer enters into their meter. This was rolled out in 2023 and allows anyone with a mobile wallet (even in remote areas) to top-up electricity without traveling to a power office ￼ ￼. These digital options are especially valuable for rural villages that have recently been electrified with solar or micro-grids – instead of periodic visits by Solomon Power staff, villagers can now pay as needed via phone. For post-paid electricity customers (e.g. some businesses or government accounts on kWh billing), Solomon Power issues monthly bills by mail or email and requires payment within 15 days ￼. Those bills can be settled by visiting Solomon Power offices to pay cash or card. In the near future, it’s expected that M-SELEN’s bill-pay feature will also support postpaid electricity bills, given that the platform has already enabled other utilities and is planning broad biller integration ￼.
• Water (Solomon Water): The water utility uses a combination of postpaid billing (for piped water in Honiara and towns) and a “CashWater” prepaid system in some areas. Postpaid water bills are issued monthly and traditionally had to be paid at Solomon Water offices or through bank deposit. Solomon Water reports that it operates cashier offices (accepting cash and EFTPOS) during the week for bill payments ￼ ￼. For example, in Honiara customers can go to the Solomon Water office, bring their bill, and pay by cash or card on the spot. In addition, Solomon Water allows direct bank payments – customers can deposit the amount into Solomon Water’s accounts at ANZ, BSP, or Bred Bank and then notify the utility for reconciliation ￼. Recognizing the inconvenience of only these traditional channels, Solomon Water has actively embraced digital payment avenues:
• The utility partnered with BSP to appear as a biller in BSP’s mobile banking USSD service, so BSP account-holders can pay water bills or purchase prepaid water units from their phone ￼.
• It also encourages use of Bred Bank’s Solomon Connect app, IumiCash, and EziPei for water payments ￼. Each of these apps added options to pay Solomon Water – for instance, IumiCash users can select Solomon Water and enter their customer number to pay a bill.
• A major development came in October 2023, when Solomon Water signed a partnership with Our Telekom to integrate water payments into M-SELEN ￼. This integration allows two key functions: purchasing CashWater (prepaid water) tokens via the M-SELEN mobile wallet, and paying postpaid water bills through the same platform ￼. The convenience gains are significant – customers no longer need to travel to a Solomon Water cashier; they can now settle their bills “from the comfort of their homes or offices, anytime and anywhere” using a phone ￼. According to Solomon Water, this added multiple new access points for customers to pay for water, aligning with its mission to improve service accessibility ￼. By late 2023, Solomon Water served about 17,000 customer connections across Honiara and provincial towns ￼, all of whom can potentially benefit from the M-SELEN payment option going live.
In summary, water payments are transitioning from 100% over-the-counter to a multi-channel system: you can still pay cash at the office, but you may also use mobile banking, a mobile wallet, or an online portal to pay. The push to add autopay and mobile options (Solomon Water even launched an online customer portal with bill pay in 2025 ￼) shows the utility sector’s recognition that digital payments can greatly enhance customer convenience in a country where traveling to an office might mean a costly boat trip.
• Telecom and other bills: Telecommunications in Solomon Islands is predominantly prepaid. Both major mobile operators (Our Telekom and the smaller operator, bmobile/Vodafone) sell prepaid airtime that customers use for calls and data. Traditionally, topping up your phone meant purchasing a scratch card or e-top-up from a local shop (ubiquitous in Honiara and present even in many villages). Now, with mobile money, this process has become even easier: M-SELEN allows users to buy mobile airtime directly from their wallet balance ￼. This has been one of the early use-cases to encourage wallet adoption. Similarly, EziPei’s app offers airtime top-up for both Telekom and bmobile networks ￼. For postpaid telecom services (like some businesses have postpaid landlines or broadband), billing is monthly. These can be paid at Our Telekom offices or through bank transfers. In the near future, Our Telekom is likely to enable M-SELEN to pay its own service bills as well, making it effectively a self-service channel for their customers.
It’s worth noting that prepaid models dominate not just in phone service but across utilities: prepaid electricity and water (“Cashpower” and “CashWater”) are increasingly common, because they suit the irregular income streams of many households. People can buy $20 SBD of power when they have cash, rather than face a large monthly bill. The prevalence of prepaid utilities actually complements digital payments – purchasing a small top-up is easier via mobile wallets than making a long trip to pay in person. The Solomon Islands’ approach is similar to Papua New Guinea’s, where utilities and telecoms also rely heavily on prepaid systems; a cultural norm has developed of paying as you go, which new digital payment services can tap into. For example, in PNG many people regularly purchase electricity credits via mobile banking or agents in small increments, a habit that Solomon Islanders are now starting to adopt with tools like M-SELEN and EziPei for their cashpower needs.

Urban vs. rural differences: In Honiara (the capital), a tech-savvy resident might already be using a mix of methods – paying the electric bill with a debit card at the utility office, topping up phone credit on an app, and soon using M-SELEN to pay water bills. Point-of-sale card terminals exist in the city’s larger supermarkets, hotels, and offices, allowing card payments in urban retail. By contrast, in rural villages these services were unheard of until mobile money arrived. Now, a person in a remote island can theoretically top up their electricity meter via a phone menu and receive a token by SMS, something revolutionary for a community that previously had to rely on a visiting agent. The expansion of agent networks means that even if one cannot pay a utility directly online, they might hand cash to a local M-SELEN agent who completes the digital payment on their behalf. This blending of physical and digital is how Solomon Islands is extending bill payment infrastructure beyond town centers.

Remittance Flows

Remittances – money sent home by Solomon Islanders working abroad or in the capital – form an important financial inflow for many families. While not as large as in some Pacific countries (like Tonga or Samoa), international remittances have grown significantly in the past decade due to labor mobility programs. Understanding remittance patterns is key for identifying pain points (like high fees and access issues) and opportunities for improvement.

Scale and importance: In 2022, total international remittance inflows were about SBD 470 million (≈ US$55 million) ￼. This was roughly 4–5% of GDP, a share that has been rising. The Central Bank notes that labor migration is an “emerging aspect” of the economy ￼. Traditionally, Solomon Islands had a relatively small diaspora, but recent labor mobility schemes (seasonal and short-term work in Australia and New Zealand) have expanded the number of citizens abroad. By mid-2023, approximately 5,000 Solomon Islanders were working in Australia under seasonal worker or Pacific Labour programs ￼, compared to only a few hundred a decade ago. New Zealand also hosts several hundred seasonal workers each year. These workers typically send a substantial portion of their earnings home to support spouses, children, and extended family.

The major remittance source countries are Australia and New Zealand, given these labor programs ￼. There are also Solomon Islanders working in regional neighbors (PNG, Fiji) or further afield (a small community in the UK and North America), but flows from those are smaller. An interesting subset of remittances involves Solomon Islanders studying abroad (e.g. on scholarships in Fiji or Australia) – their stipends or family support might count as remittances in some cases. Another growing category is repatriated savings from seasonal workers: for example, upon finishing a stint in Australia, workers withdraw their accumulated superannuation or savings and bring it back, which shows up as a lump-sum remittance.

Remittance channels: The vast majority of international remittances are sent via formal money transfer operators (MTOs), especially Western Union. Western Union has long been the dominant player in the Pacific and maintains agent locations in Solomon Islands (often through local banks or postal offices). However, coverage is sparse: until recently WU agents were only located in Honiara and a couple of other towns (e.g. Auki in Malaita, and possibly Gizo or Munda) ￼ ￼. This means a recipient in a rural area must travel to a town to collect the cash. Other MTOs like MoneyGram or Ria were less visible historically, though this is starting to change (see emerging solutions below). Bank transfers (wire remittances) are used as well, particularly for larger amounts or by Solomon Islanders who have bank accounts in Australia/NZ. But since most rural recipients at home do not have a local bank account, a wire transfer often isn’t practical for them – they prefer cash pick-up services. There are also some online remittance platforms (for example, KlickEx Pacific has been used in the region to send money from New Zealand into Pacific bank accounts or wallets). As of 2022, a local microfinance (SPBD) was exploring partnering with KlickEx to facilitate remittances in other countries ￼, though in Solomon Islands such services are not yet mainstream.

Crucially, a huge portion of remittances still move through informal channels. People commonly send money with friends, relatives, or “housemates” traveling back home. This might be literally handing someone cash to deliver to your family in the village. Estimates suggest these informal flows are significant but hard to quantify ￼. For domestic (internal) remittances, the informal share is extremely high – about 72% of people sending money within the country do so via cash carried by someone (bus driver, boat, or hand-delivery) rather than any formal service ￼ ￼. Internationally, informal sending is a bit less (due to the distance) but still occurs whenever there’s an opportunity (e.g. a community member returning from Australia might collectively carry funds for friends).

Costs and friction: The cost of sending money to Solomon Islands is among the highest in the world. According to the World Bank’s Remittance Prices database, sending money from Australia to Solomon Islands can incur fees and exchange margins that average around 11% of the amount sent ￼. By comparison, the global average cost is about 6%, and G20 nations have a target to reduce it to 5% or lower. For Solomon Islanders sending $200–$300, an 11% fee is a heavy burden. In practice, fees vary by service: commercial banks might charge a flat wire fee (say AUD $25 on any amount), which for small transfers is very high percentage-wise; Western Union and MoneyGram have sliding scales but can charge 5-10% on modest sums. For example, sending AUD $500 from Australia to Solomon Islands cost anywhere from ~3.2% up to 15% in fees depending on the provider as of 2023 ￼ ￼. Aside from cost, accessibility is a problem: with few agent locations, recipients often spend additional time and money to travel and collect funds. In rural areas, even knowing a transfer is ready can be an issue (though mobile phones help with receiving the MTO reference number by SMS).

Another friction point has been compliance and delays – e.g. if a large remittance is sent, sometimes recipients without proper ID struggle to retrieve it due to strict KYC (Know Your Customer) rules. Western Union in Solomon Islands for a long time required ID verification at the main branch in Honiara for first-time recipients ￼, which is obviously inconvenient. These hurdles push some senders to either use informal means or send less frequently but in larger lump sums.

Use of remittances: Studies and anecdotal evidence indicate that remittances to Solomon Islands are primarily used for basic household needs and community obligations. Families spend the funds on food, school fees, home improvements, church donations, bride price payments, etc. In many cases, remittances are the only source of cash for rural households that otherwise rely on subsistence farming. There is also a cultural norm of sharing – money received might be redistributed to extended family or saved for community events. This means having cash in hand is important; recipients will typically withdraw the full amount sent rather than keep it in a bank account (if they even have one). One early benefit observed with M-SELEN mobile money is that some recipients choose to keep e-value stored for a while rather than immediately cashing out, because they feel it’s safer than carrying cash ￼. But generally, until digital ecosystems mature (where one could directly spend the remittance from the wallet on goods or services), cash-out will remain the immediate step after receiving a remittance.

Recent and upcoming improvements: There are a few promising developments aimed at reducing remittance costs and improving access:
• Mobile money integrations: In late 2025, Our Telekom announced an integration of M-SELEN with Ria Money Transfer, a global remittance company ￼. This partnership enables Solomon Islanders abroad (or anyone using Ria’s network in 200+ countries) to send money directly into an M-SELEN mobile wallet back home ￼ ￼. Likewise, someone in Solomon Islands can initiate an international remittance via M-SELEN to a Ria payout location abroad (though the primary use-case is inbound). This is a significant shift – instead of a mother in a village traveling to town and standing in line at a WU agent, she could receive money instantly on her phone and then decide whether to cash out at a local agent or spend it electronically. It also potentially lowers fees; mobile-to-mobile remittances often carry lower overhead than cash agent services. This Ria integration effectively turns M-SELEN into a digital remittance hub for the country, and reflects a broader Pacific trend (for example, Fiji’s Vodafone M-PAiSA wallet now directly receives remittances from partners abroad, dramatically growing its remittance volumes).
• Alternative providers and fintech: The Central Bank (CBSI) has been encouraging new remittance channels. As noted, IumiCash received a license as a Money Transfer Service, which could allow it to facilitate cross-border transfers, possibly by partnering with a fintech or regional service ￼. Additionally, initiatives under the Pacific Islands Forum and development agencies are exploring fintech solutions like blockchain-based remittances or regional payment hubs to cut costs. One pilot concept is to use stablecoins or digital currencies to transmit value cheaply between, say, Australia and Solomon Islands, then convert to local currency on arrival. While there’s no large-scale stablecoin usage in Solomon Islands yet, the interest in such technology is a response to the stubbornly high fees through traditional channels ￼ ￼. The success of any such solution will depend on easy cash-out options and regulator buy-in.
• Diaspora accounts and banking integration: Banks like BSP and Bred Bank have started to offer tailored products for seasonal workers – for instance, facilitating direct deposits of wages into accounts that families can access at home. Australia and NZ, through their labor mobility programs, also have schemes to help workers remit savings (some employers organize collective remittances or offer financial literacy to encourage sending money through cheaper methods). Over time, these efforts could shift some volume away from expensive MTOs toward bank transfers or digital wallets.

In summary, remittances are a lifeline for many Solomon Islander households, and while the inflows are growing, the system to carry those flows remains costly and cumbersome. A person in Honiara sending money to a village, or a brother in Australia sending money home, both face “last-mile” issues – how to get it to the recipient safely and cheaply. The ongoing digital initiatives (mobile wallets, fintech partnerships, and regional integration) are aimed at both reducing fees and expanding reach, so that remittances can more efficiently fuel development. As seen in comparable contexts like PNG, building trust in new channels is key: many Pacific Islanders initially distrust non-traditional remittance methods, so it will take success stories and reliable service to move the needle. The Solomon Islands government and Central Bank recognize this and are actively supporting innovations that could make sending money home instant, low-cost, and accessible even in a remote village.

Income Segments and Financial Behaviors

Financial behaviors in the Solomon Islands vary widely across income levels and between urban and rural populations. Here we break down some characteristics of middle/high-income urban residents versus the general population, and how they engage with banks and payment systems. Understanding these segments is crucial for tailoring services (especially if entering as a telecom or fintech provider).

Urban middle and high-income segment (Honiara and provincial centers): This group includes formally employed individuals (public servants, professionals, business owners, etc.) who have relatively steady incomes. Key features of this segment:
• Banking relationships: Middle-class urbanites are the most likely to have bank accounts. Commercial banks in Solomon Islands naturally concentrate on this customer base – indeed, there’s a noted correlation that salaried people in Honiara are far more likely to own a bank account, whereas rural and informal earners are not ￼. These customers often receive their salaries via direct deposit. For example, a government employee in Honiara might be paid to a BSP or ANZ account and then use an ATM to withdraw cash for daily needs. As of 2020, the banks had about 149,000 active customer accounts ￼, and it’s safe to say a large portion of those belong to urban residents. Many in this group also contribute to the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SINPF) – they have SINPF membership cards, which are one form of formal ID (around 24% of adults hold an NPF ID card) ￼.
• Payment preferences: Historically, even middle-income Solomon Islanders used cash for most transactions because electronic acceptance was limited. But this is changing. In Honiara today, a professional might use EFTPOS or a debit card at supermarkets, restaurants, and hotels that cater to the middle class or expatriates. The Solomon Islands has several thousand EFTPOS terminals, but note that domestic inter-bank card interoperability is limited – if your card is issued by BSP (domestic-only card) and the shop has an ANZ machine, it might not work unless it’s a Visa card ￼. To avoid that, many higher-income individuals carry Visa debit cards (around 40,000 Visa-enabled bank cards are in circulation locally ￼). Credit cards are not widespread, but a few elite or business travelers have them (often issued from overseas banks). For big purchases (appliances, airline tickets), this group is more comfortable using a bank transfer or card payment than the average citizen.
• Digital and mobile usage: Urban residents have much greater access to smartphones and internet. Even by 2020, urban internet penetration was far above the national 28% average ￼ – Honiara has 3G/4G coverage and WiFi hotspots. Smartphone ownership in cities has grown rapidly; affordable Android phones from brands like Huawei and Samsung are popular. This means many middle-class Solomon Islanders are active on social media (Facebook is huge) and increasingly open to digital apps for financial services. Banks report growing enrollment in their internet banking and mobile app services among this clientele ￼. For example, Bred Bank’s Solomon Connect app allows checking balances, transferring funds, and even scanning QR codes to pay certain merchants ￼. Uptake of these apps is still in the early stages, but it’s a sign of an emerging digital banking culture in the capital.
Additionally, this demographic has been early to adopt mobile wallets like M-SELEN. Many young professionals find it convenient to use M-SELEN for P2P transfers – e.g., sending money to relatives in the village, or splitting a restaurant bill with friends. The UNCDF reported stories of users in Honiara who signed up for M-SELEN right away and found it “transformative,” citing safety (not carrying wads of cash) and speed in helping out family back home ￼ ￼. Such users also express desire for more features like direct bank-to-wallet transfers and international remittances in-app ￼. This suggests that urban customers see mobile money as a complement to banking: they might keep a bank account for savings or salary, but use the mobile wallet for everyday small transactions and sending money to unbanked relatives.
• Smartphone penetration and tech literacy: While exact smartphone stats are not published, one proxy is that less than 20% of Solomon Islanders had electricity at home as of a few years ago (around 80% lack reliable power ￼), yet you will find smartphones even in villages, often charged via solar panels or generators. In Honiara, almost every working adult and student will have a phone, and increasingly that phone is a smartphone. Digital literacy among the youth and working class in town is relatively high – English is widely understood, and people navigate apps easily. The country’s digital literacy score is better than some peers ￼, though still behind global standards. Middle-income parents in Honiara have started using online channels to pay school fees or shop on Facebook marketplaces, indicating a comfort with online transactions when available.
• Attitudes toward new products: This segment tends to be open to innovation and convenience. They may not have had many options in the past, but when something like mobile banking or a QR payment is introduced, they are quick to try if it solves a problem. For example, when fuel stations started accepting BSP’s mobile payments, or when utility bills went online, the urban middle class led the adoption. One reason is they often have the required pieces in place: ID documents to register for services, enough income to maintain a balance in a mobile wallet, and the confidence to resolve any issues with customer support. Culturally, urban Solomon Islanders (especially younger ones) are not very different from urban Papua New Guineans – there’s a growing sense of tech-savvy identity, and peer influence is strong. If one person in an office starts using a new payment app and finds it useful, others will follow.

Lower-income and rural population: This group makes up the majority of Solomon Islanders – subsistence farmers, market vendors, fishermen, and others in informal livelihoods, scattered across many islands. Their financial behavior is markedly different:
• Cash-based and informal savings: Rural folks operate almost entirely in cash or barter. Income is seasonal and erratic (selling crops, occasional logging royalties, etc.), so they rarely have excess to put in a bank. Instead, they may save by keeping cash hidden at home or investing in community schemes (like a savings club). The concept of a bank can be intimidating or seen as “not for them.” A 2019 survey highlighted typical barriers: people cited long distance to banks and lack of documentation as reasons for not having an account ￼ ￼. Also, financial literacy is limited – many villagers have only basic education, so formal banking paperwork or interfaces are challenging. That said, nearly every adult in rural areas is familiar with using mobile phones and phone credit as quasi-currency (topping up someone’s airtime is a common small-value transfer).
• Mobile ownership and usage: Mobile phone access in rural areas has exploded in the past decade. Even without electricity, villages find ways to charge phones (solar chargers, car batteries). The penetration of at least basic mobile handsets is high. However, smartphone penetration is lower in rural areas compared to Honiara. Many villagers still use basic feature phones capable of calls and SMS only. This makes USSD/SMS-based financial services crucial – for instance, M-SELEN’s \*123# menu is designed for those without internet or smartphones. Early reports show rural uptake of M-SELEN via USSD has been strong, because it does not require literacy in English or a fancy phone; menus can be followed in Pijin and transactions confirmed by text ￼ ￼. Interestingly, even those who can’t read well might use memorized number sequences or get help from an agent to navigate the steps. Over time, as cheaper Android phones proliferate and 3G coverage extends, more rural users will get on apps – but for now, simplicity is key.
• Trust and cultural factors: Rural and low-income people are generally conservative with new financial tools. Trust is built through personal relationships. For example, they might be wary of depositing cash with a distant institution, but they trust their local savings club because it’s run by a neighbor, or they trust an M-SELEN agent who is a known shopkeeper in the community. This is analogous to PNG, where rural adoption of mobile money lagged until agents were very embedded in communities. Solomon Islanders have a communal culture (the wantok system) where sharing and mutual support are expected. Any product that is too individualized (e.g. personal bank savings) sometimes conflicted with the obligation to share resources. Mobile money is interesting in this regard: it provides a privacy to money that cash doesn’t (people might not know you have $50 mobile balance), yet it’s also shareable in that you can easily send to family. So it may gradually shift norms about keeping money.
It’s noted that women and rural dwellers were disproportionately excluded from the formal financial system ￼. Products that cater to their needs – low fees, no minimum balance, menus in local language – stand a better chance. Anecdotally, when YouSave (the SINPF voluntary pension) allowed market vendors to save via mobile top-up, thousands of informal workers (especially women) enrolled, because it fit their lifestyle of saving a few dollars when they could ￼. It shows that rural/low-income people will use a financial service if it’s approachable and clearly beneficial.
• Payment preferences and needs: For most rural folks, daily transactions are buying and selling at local markets (all in cash) and possibly paying school fees or church tithes. Larger payments – like paying for school in town, or buying hardware materials – often involve physically carrying cash to the recipient. Remittances from working family members are a critical inflow; receiving cash from town or abroad is a major event. Given the lack of stores or POS in villages, there hasn’t been a need for card payments locally. This is why mobile money’s person-to-person capability is its “killer app” for rural users – it directly replaces the need to send cash by boat or bus. A villager might not yet be using their M-SELEN account to buy goods (since the shop in the village wouldn’t accept it), but they value it to receive support from relatives. Over time, as agent networks mature, rural merchants might start accepting mobile payments (especially if it means the merchant can more easily travel to town to restock using e-money rather than carrying cash).
• PNG comparison – cultural adoption: Like rural Papua New Guineans, rural Solomon Islanders place huge importance on face-to-face interaction and word-of-mouth influence. In PNG, one strategy that eventually helped mobile money (like Digicel CellMoni) was enlisting local church groups and NGOs to demonstrate and endorse the service, leveraging trust networks. We can expect a similar dynamic in Solomon Islands. A new entrant must engage community leaders or influential groups to build credibility. Another parallel: both countries have diverse languages and some degree of oral tradition, meaning visual and verbal education (radio programs, village workshops, explanatory videos in Pijin) can be more effective than printed brochures in English. Recognizing these cultural nuances is crucial for any go-to-market strategy targeting the mass market in Solomon Islands.

In summary, the urban, relatively well-off segment is inching toward a modern banking/digital experience – using ATMs, cards, and smartphone apps when available – while the majority of Solomon Islanders still operate informally. However, the leapfrogging effect of mobile technology is apparent. The fact that a fisherman on a remote atoll can now send money by phone to his supplier in the capital (something he never would have done via a bank) indicates that the gap between the segments may narrow with the right services. From a commercial viewpoint, a telecommunications or fintech entrant would likely target the urban middle class first (for quick uptake and revenue) but must ultimately win over the rural masses for volume growth. The recipe will include user education, ultra-simple user experience, and aligning services with ingrained behaviors (like enabling lots of small-value, pay-as-you-go transactions which people are used to).

Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape in the Solomon Islands is increasingly conducive to digital finance, thanks to proactive steps by the Central Bank and government in recent years. Any new payment or telecom entrant will find a framework that encourages innovation but also places emphasis on consumer protection, stability, and financial integrity. Key aspects of the regulatory environment include:
• Central Bank leadership: The Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) is the chief regulator for banking, payments, and now fintech. CBSI has been a champion of financial inclusion – it led the formulation of three successive National Financial Inclusion Strategies (NFIS 1 in 2011, NFIS 2 in 2016, and NFIS 3 for 2021–2025) ￼ ￼. These strategies explicitly prioritize digital financial services to reach underserved populations. CBSI’s commitments under the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (like the Maya Declaration and Denarau Action Plan) have translated into concrete policy goals such as bringing more women into the formal financial system and expanding access points in rural areas ￼ ￼. This means regulators are not only allowing new services but actively seeking them. For example, CBSI set a target of 400,000 active financial service users by 2025 (50% women) and 1,155 total access points across the country ￼. Achieving this requires mobile and agent-based models, so the Central Bank has been relatively quick to license and support non-bank players.
• Payment Systems Act 2022: A milestone in modernizing the regulatory framework was the passing of the National Payment Systems Act 2022. This law updated outdated financial legislation and gave CBSI clear authority to oversee and regulate payment service providers and systems ￼ ￼. It essentially provides the legal basis for digital wallets, electronic payments, and interoperability frameworks. Under this Act, CBSI can license entities as electronic money issuers or payment service operators. For instance, Telekom’s subsidiary received a license under this regime to operate M-SELEN as a mobile money service (the Terms & Conditions explicitly note it is licensed by CBSI) ￼. The Act also empowers CBSI to issue directives on standards, such as mandating interoperability or setting transaction limits for e-money. Moreover, it mandates CBSI to oversee the implementation of infrastructure like the national switch or RTGS.
• Regulatory sandbox and fintech innovation: CBSI has shown openness to innovation by creating a Regulatory Sandbox, allowing fintech products to be tested under supervision. IumiCash, for example, was admitted as the third applicant in the sandbox to trial its e-wallet solution ￼. Likewise, the mobileFund digital loan product (a partnership between SINPF, UNCDF, and fintech company Yabx) was tested in CBSI’s sandbox in 2023–24 ￼ ￼. This sandbox approach lets the regulator observe risks and customer outcomes closely before granting full approval. It signals that a new entrant with an innovative idea can work with the Central Bank in a phased manner, rather than needing to comply with every rule from day one. That said, CBSI will still demand responsible practices – e.g. ensuring data security, fair pricing, and proper disclosures during the sandbox trials.
• Licensing of mobile money and payment providers: Post-2022, CBSI created specific licensing categories for non-bank financial service providers. Telekom Digital Ltd. (Our Telekom’s fintech arm) was licensed as a deposit-taking mobile money issuer under the new rules ￼. Other entities like EziPei (through Solomon Post) and fintech startups have obtained either Payment Service Provider licenses or Money Transfer Operator (MTO) licenses, depending on their business model ￼. All licensed providers are subject to regulations on know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection. For example, there are tiered KYC requirements: basic wallets with small transaction limits might be opened with just a SIM registration and ID number, whereas higher-value accounts need full ID verification. This tiered approach helps inclusion (poor people can access basic services easily) while managing risks.
• SIM registration and digital ID: A related regulatory move is the enforcement of SIM card registration. A law passed in 2021 requires that all mobile SIMs be registered to a user with a valid ID ￼ ￼. This process is ongoing, with operators now recording customers’ details. Over time, the SIM registration database can serve as a foundational digital ID repository that fintech services might leverage for KYC ￼. Given that about 55% of adults have a voter ID and a quarter have an NPF ID ￼, linking these to SIMs will greatly simplify customer due diligence for mobile financial services. The government is also exploring a national digital ID system in the long run ￼. For now, from a regulatory standpoint, any telecom or mobile money provider must ensure compliance with the SIM registration Act and be prepared to verify user identities through approved documents (passport, voter card, etc.).
• Central Bank infrastructure upgrades: CBSI isn’t just making rules – it’s also upgrading infrastructure to support those rules. In 2024, the Central Bank rolled out the Solomon Islands Automated Transfer System (SIATS or SOLATS), a modern payments infrastructure comprising a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system for high-value payments and an Automated Clearing House for retail payments ￼. This replaced manual interbank cheque clearing and now allows instant interbank transfers, improving efficiency across the economy ￼. The existence of SOLATS means that if mobile money providers connect to the system (directly or via sponsor banks), interoperability and quick settlements between wallets and bank accounts will be possible. Indeed, SOLATS was designed with inclusion in mind – it can handle high volumes and small payments, enabling the national switch for digital payments ￼. The Payment Systems Act mandates CBSI to pursue such interoperability, so we may see regulations requiring that e-money issuers eventually connect to a national payment switch for seamless transactions between different wallets and bank accounts ￼. For a new entrant, this means the plumbing for a more integrated ecosystem is falling into place, and one should design systems to be compliant with these upcoming interoperability standards.
• Consumer protection and pricing: Regulators are conscious of protecting consumers in this new digital era. The Central Bank has issued directives on transparent pricing (e.g., no hidden fees for mobile money). M-SELEN, for instance, uses a pay-as-you-go fee model with published tariffs for each transaction type ￼ ￼. There’s also attention to cybersecurity and data protection – while Solomon Islands does not yet have a comprehensive data protection law, work is underway (with donor support) to draft one ￼. Any digital financial service is expected to employ adequate security measures (encryption, PIN protection, etc.), and CBSI closely monitors this through its oversight role. As the digital finance sector grows, we can anticipate more formal regulations on e-money float management, agent supervision, and dispute resolution frameworks to be put in place. Currently, CBSI requires that the value of mobile wallet floats be backed 100% by trust accounts in commercial banks, to protect customers in case of provider insolvency (a common rule in mobile money worldwide).
• Cryptocurrency and stablecoin stance: The CBSI’s position on cryptocurrencies is cautious. It has explicitly warned the public that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not legal tender and are unregulated – effectively discouraging people from investing or trading in them due to risks of fraud or loss ￼ ￼. In a public notice, CBSI stated it does not endorse any unregulated crypto and reminded that the Solomon Islands dollar is the only official currency. This means that for now, crypto exchanges or crypto-based remittance services do not operate openly in the country (and any attempt to introduce such would face regulatory scrutiny). However, in a forward-looking move, CBSI is exploring a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). In November 2023, it launched a proof-of-concept pilot for a digital Solomon Islands dollar dubbed “Bokolo Cash.” (“Bokolo” refers to shell money traditionally used in parts of Solomons.) The pilot, in collaboration with Japanese fintech Soramitsu, uses a permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Iroha) to issue digital tokens worth 1 SBD each ￼ ￼. These tokens are being tested for domestic payments and even simulated cross-border transfers within a closed group of participants ￼ ￼. Bokolo Cash is currently only a trial (not available to the general public), but it underscores CBSI’s innovative approach – they are essentially test-driving a stablecoin-like digital currency that, if implemented, would be regulated and sovereign (unlike private crypto). The PoC involves select merchants in Honiara accepting Bokolo from users who have digital wallets provided for the test ￼ ￼. The Central Bank governor and even the Prime Minister have expressed optimism that a CBDC could improve financial inclusion and payment efficiency in the future ￼ ￼. The pilot also looks at interoperability by bridging the CBDC to a public blockchain network (SORA) to simulate how international remittances might work with digital currencies ￼ ￼.
For now, no laws or guidelines specifically govern stablecoins or cryptocurrency beyond general warnings. But if Bokolo Cash moves forward, CBSI would likely draft regulations to integrate a CBDC into the financial system (including possibly amending the CBSI Act to recognize digital currency) ￼. A new entrant in the payment space should keep an eye on this area – while directly dealing with crypto is not on the table, the long-term strategy might involve connecting with the national digital currency if it becomes reality. The regulator’s priority is clearly to modernize payments in a safe, inclusive way – meaning they prefer innovations under their oversight (like a CBDC or regulated mobile money) rather than uncontrolled private cryptocurrencies.

In sum, the regulatory environment in Solomon Islands can be characterized as supportive but prudent. The government and CBSI have laid down a roadmap that encourages new players to help extend financial services (through legislation like the Payment Systems Act and initiatives like NFIS), and they have created the technical and legal infrastructure to back it (like SOLATS and licensing regimes). At the same time, they maintain vigilance on risks: ensuring adequate KYC/AML, discouraging unregulated crypto schemes, and insisting on interoperability and consumer fairness. For a telecom company entering the market with an eye on digital financial services, this means you will find a willing partner in the Central Bank – one that will facilitate entry (via sandbox or licenses) as long as your service aligns with national inclusion goals and you play by the rules.

Emerging and Potential Payment Solutions

Looking ahead, several emerging solutions and opportunities could further transform the Solomon Islands’ payment landscape. These range from regional integration initiatives to leveraging lessons from other markets, and even novel technologies like stablecoins. For a new market entrant, understanding these trends can inform a forward-looking strategy that not only meets current needs but also anticipates future developments.

Regional payment integration: The Pacific region’s small economies often struggle with high remittance costs and limited financial infrastructure, so there’s momentum toward regional integration of payment systems. Solomon Islands is part of the Pacific Islands Regional Initiative (PIRI) under the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, where central banks share strategies on digital finance. One practical step is exploring a regional switch or hub to link domestic payment systems. For example, if Solomon Islands’ new SOLATS infrastructure can connect with similar systems in, say, Fiji or Papua New Guinea, it could enable more direct and cheaper cross-border transfers. There is also ongoing work under organizations like the Pacific Islands Forum and Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme to harmonize payment regulations and possibly create a regional mobile wallet acceptance network ￼ ￼. Though in early stages, the idea is that a person in Samoa could send money to a Solomon Islands mobile wallet through a unified platform, or a Fijian tourist could use their domestic mobile wallet to pay in Honiara. Achieving this would require multilateral agreements and technical interoperability (shared standards, messaging formats like ISO20022, etc.), which are being discussed. As a telecom or fintech, aligning with such efforts (e.g., ensuring your system is compatible with regional standards) could be advantageous.

Lowering remittance costs – new corridors and competition: As noted, partnerships like M-SELEN with Ria are bringing new competition to the remittance space ￼. We can expect Western Union and others to respond, perhaps by integrating with mobile wallets too or lowering fees. Additionally, Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific governments are actively seeking to cut remittance prices (Australia has a Pacific Remittance Remittance Challenge Fund that has supported fintech solutions in other countries). This environment may see the entrance of digital remittance startups: for instance, WorldRemit or MoneyGram online could start serving Solomon Islands more fully, leveraging the rising mobile wallet ecosystem as endpoints. A new telecom entrant could consider facilitating its own remittance channel – for example, partnering with a fintech that uses a web/mobile app to collect AUD/NZD in Australia and then credits users in Solomon Islands (either to a bank account, cash-out agent, or mobile wallet). This kind of tie-up could both generate revenue (through FX margins) and drive wallet adoption if the telecom’s wallet becomes a preferred payout method.

Stablecoins and digital currencies: While caution is warranted, there is a forward-looking opportunity in stablecoins for remittances and inclusion. A “stablecoin” is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable value like USD. In the Pacific context, one could imagine a stablecoin tied to the Solomon Dollar or Australian Dollar used for cross-border transfers. The Lowy Institute has discussed a model of using stablecoins to deliver aid or basic income in remote islands ￼, which hints at their potential. For Solomon Islands, one practical path is via the Bokolo Cash CBDC pilot. If this project succeeds and scales, Solomon Islands might be among the first Pacific nations with a national digital currency. That could open the door to very low-cost transfers (since sending a CBDC token internationally, via a blockchain bridge, could bypass many intermediaries) ￼ ￼. For example, a Solomon Islander in Australia could buy “Solomon CBDC” tokens (Bokolo) through a remittance app and instantly send them on-chain to their family’s wallet, who then cash out via a local agent. This scenario is speculative but not far-fetched given the pilot’s goals. A private entrant could collaborate in such an ecosystem by providing the wallet infrastructure or agent network for a CBDC, or by using a stablecoin as the backend for its own services (subject to regulatory approval).

Outside of the official CBDC, one might consider existing USD- or AUD-pegged stablecoins to cut remittance costs. However, in the near term, regulatory acceptance of that is low; any on-ramp/off-ramp for stablecoins would need CBSI’s buy-in. A wise approach for a new player is to engage with the Central Bank early if exploring blockchain-based solutions – CBSI is open to innovation (as seen with Soramitsu’s involvement) but will insist on oversight and risk mitigation. In essence, the door is open to modern digital currency solutions, but they must be in a controlled, transparent form (likely central bank-led rather than fully decentralized crypto).

Merchant payments and the digital ecosystem expansion: So far, mobile money in Solomon Islands has been used mostly for P2P and basic services, but the next frontier is merchant payments (P2B) – i.e., enabling people to pay shops, transport, schools, etc., using digital means instead of cash. Our Telekom has already introduced “M-SELEN Merchant”, a feature that lets customers pay merchants via their mobile wallet (presumably through a QR code scan or an agent-assisted transaction) ￼. By late 2025, this merchant payment platform was operational with a promotion campaign to encourage uptake ￼. This is a critical step to entrench digital usage: when people can buy everyday goods like rice, noodles, and fuel with their phone, they have less need to cash-out e-money ￼. The early reports indicate M-SELEN merchants charge no extra fees to customers and minimal fees to merchants to encourage adoption ￼ ￼.

A new telecom entrant could aim to either interoperate with this merchant network or develop its own if launching a wallet. However, given Solomon’s small market, a fragmented merchant acceptance network is not ideal – interoperability will be key so that a shop doesn’t have to support multiple QR codes or agent devices. One model could be to partner with existing payment aggregators. In Fiji and PNG, we’ve seen companies like Kina Bank or Bank South Pacific deploy QR code payment systems that multiple wallets can plug into. The Solomon Islands might follow suit – e.g., if Bred Bank’s QR and M-SELEN’s QR could be read by each other’s apps, or if a common QR standard (like Alipay-style or EMVCo) is adopted via the national switch. Regulatory nudges toward open-loop solutions (as mentioned in the retail payments report ￼ ￼) might push this along.

Beyond retail purchases, other use cases are emerging: government payments and salaries. The government is interested in paying social welfare or rural health worker salaries through digital means to cut down cash handling. Trials of paying constituency funds or fisheries royalties through mobile wallets could happen. Similarly, services like school fee payments or church donations via mobile are low-hanging fruits that some Pacific neighbors have implemented.

Learning from international examples: It’s instructive to look at similar markets where telecom-led payment systems succeeded:
• Kenya’s M-Pesa: Often cited, M-Pesa achieved nationwide adoption by heavily investing in agent networks and starting with P2P transfers as the core service (which Solomon Islands is mirroring). It then expanded to bill payments, merchant pay, savings, loans, etc. The lesson here: build scale with a simple use-case, then diversify. M-SELEN appears to be on this trajectory (next adding loans via mobileFund, and merchant payments) ￼ ￼. A new entrant could replicate such a roadmap and even introduce adjacent services like micro-insurance (for example, bundling life or crop insurance with wallet usage, as was done in other countries).
• Fiji’s Vodafone M-PAiSA: Closer to home, M-PAiSA in Fiji (launched by a telco in 2010) struggled initially but took off in the last 5 years after integrating with the banking system and international remittances. Today, M-PAiSA processes over FJD $100 million per month in transactions and has moved beyond just P2P into serving as a platform for e-commerce, QR payments, and government services ￼ ￼. It even facilitated FJ$55 million a month in inbound remittances in 2022 via partnerships with money transfer operators ￼. This shows the potential scale for a mobile wallet even in a small island economy, once multiple use-cases are aggregated. Solomon Islands, with a smaller population, may not reach those absolute numbers soon, but if half the population is transacting by phone, the velocity of money through digital wallets could be substantial. For a telecom entrant, the Fiji case underscores the importance of extending services (utility payments, govt payments, etc.) and integrating with global networks to drive usage.
• Papua New Guinea: PNG’s experience with mobile money has been mixed, but it offers cautionary lessons. Earlier efforts like MiCash (by BSP) and CellMoni (by Digicel) have taught that simply launching the service isn’t enough – agent liquidity, user education, and continuous product iteration are necessary. PNG found that many agents in rural areas struggled to maintain float for cash-outs, which undermined trust. Also, illiteracy and fraud (e.g., scams targeting mobile money users) slowed adoption. Applying this to Solomon Islands: ensure agents are well-supported (perhaps by a “master agent” model as Our Telekom uses, where Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme helped set up a master agent company) ￼, and invest in financial literacy campaigns. Partnering with NGOs or churches to educate users on how to use mobile wallets safely will pay dividends. The Melanesian cultural context in PNG meant people were skeptical of giving money to agents at first; Solomon Islands may be similar, so demonstrating reliability (success stories, public endorsements by community leaders) will be key to spreading usage beyond early adopters.

Infrastructure and last-mile innovations: Lastly, it’s worth mentioning some pragmatic innovations that could solve Solomon Islands’ unique challenges. Since only around 20% of the population has access to grid electricity ￼, solutions like solar-powered phone charging stations at agent shops could encourage people to come, charge their phone, and perhaps do a transaction. Some projects in Vanuatu and PNG have tried this synergy. Similarly, offline-capable solutions (like stored-value cards or NFC tags that can transfer value between phones without network) could be explored for outer islands with intermittent connectivity. While these are not mainstream yet, a telecom entrant might pilot them to differentiate its service in hard-to-reach areas.

Another area is integration with the resource sector and large employers. In PNG, some mining and agribusiness companies started paying wages via mobile wallets for workers in remote sites, because it’s safer than cash. Solomon Islands has logging camps, fisheries, and potentially mining in future – partnering with those industries to pay employees or communities through digital wallets could accelerate adoption (and fulfill a corporate social responsibility angle of those companies).

Overall, the trajectory in the Solomon Islands is clear: the country is moving from a cash-heavy, unconnected financial system to a digital, interconnected network that leverages the ubiquity of mobile phones. The key gaps in the current system (limited rural access, high remittance costs, heavy reliance on cash) are precisely the opportunities that new payment solutions can target. A telecommunications provider entering this market can succeed by filling these gaps – for instance, by expanding agent networks to the last mile, offering lower-cost remittance channels, and creating user-friendly digital payment options that align with local habits. And importantly, doing so in collaboration with regulators and existing stakeholders: the CBSI will support innovations that drive inclusion, utilities will partner to digitize payments (as seen with water and power), and even traditional banks may collaborate (for interoperability and wider reach).

In conclusion, the Solomon Islands’ financial ecosystem is at an inflection point. The foundational elements – policy support, improving infrastructure, and a willing population – are in place for a digital payments revolution, much like what occurred in other developing regions. Companies that understand the full spectrum – from the informal cash economy to advanced digital finance – and design solutions bridging those worlds, stand to play a transformative role. With cultural awareness (learning from Melanesian neighbors like PNG) and strategic partnerships, a new entrant can help shape a more inclusive and efficient financial future in the Solomon Islands, while also establishing a strong foothold in its nascent digital economy.
