## Description
Discover how VO2 max and heart rate variability (HRV) predict longevity better than traditional risk factors, and learn the foundational lifestyle framework to optimize both. This evidence-based deep dive reveals that each 1-MET improvement in VO2 max reduces all-cause mortality by 11-17%, while optimal sleep (7-8 hours) and the Mediterranean diet create synergistic effects that can prevent over 80% of cardiovascular events. Episode 1 of a 4-part series establishing the foundations—subsequent episodes cover advanced training protocols, HRV-guided recovery, and evidence-based supplementation.
