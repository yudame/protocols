## Supplement Research

### Nitrates / Beetroot Juice

**Meta-Analysis of 73 Trials**
- Dietary nitrate improved power output, time to exhaustion, and distance in endurance tests; no consistent VO2max improvement but lower O2 cost at submaximal intensities
- Typical performance improvements ~1-3%, greater effects in less-trained vs elite
- Effective dosing: ~6-8 mmol nitrate (~500 mL beetroot juice or concentrated shots) 2-3 hours pre-exercise

- Strong evidence for strength/power, fat-free mass, repeated sprint ability; less clear for pure VO2max but improves training quality
- Protocol: 0.3 g/kg/d for 5-7 days loading then 3-5 g/d, or straight 3-5 g/d (saturates in ~3-4 weeks)

**Creatine + HIIT Study (6 weeks)**
- https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/4536039
- 10g creatine on training days (split pre/post) 3×/week with Wingate HIIT increased anaerobic power and leg strength vs HIIT alone

### Beta-Alanine

**GSSIWEB Review - Beta-Alanine Update**

## Longevity & Age-Related Research

**JAMA Treadmill Cohort Study (~122,000 patients)**
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29293447/
- Large cohort showing graded inverse relationship between CRF and mortality; low to elite CRF associated with up to 5-fold difference in mortality risk

**CRF as Predictor of Longevity - Frontiers in Bioscience Review**
- https://article.imrpress.com/journal/FBL/23/8/10.2741/4657/Landmark4657.pdf
- Each 1-MET (~3.5 mL/kg/min) higher VO2max associated with ~8-15% lower all-cause mortality risk
- VO2max labeled a key predictor of longevity; improvements at any age translate into substantial relative risk reduction

**CRF & Mortality Meta-Analysis**
- Each 1-MET higher CRF ≈ 13% lower all-cause mortality and 15% lower CVD risk in generally healthy adults
- Elite CRF shows lowest mortality with no upper harm threshold detected

**VO2max Decline with Age**
- ~5-10% per decade after age 30 in sedentary adults
- Endurance-trained people show similar or slightly higher % decline but from higher starting level
- Lifelong endurance training can attenuate decline and preserve performance 3-4-fold above sedentary peers

**VO2max Decline in Trained vs Untrained Meta-Analysis**
- Endurance-trained adults can roughly halve the rate of decline vs sedentary adults
- At 40, advanced training can still move VO2max ~5-10% over 8-12 weeks

- Mechanisms: ↓ plasma volume, ↓ stroke volume, ↑ HR at given workload

**Long-Term Detraining (>4 weeks)**
- Average VO2max declines of ~9.4%; no major additional declines beyond ~90 days
- VO2max reductions 6-20% reported in athletes; structural cardiac and muscular reversals

**Detraining Mechanisms Study**

- Modern watches estimate VO2max from submaximal HR + GPS
- Correlations to lab VO2max reasonably strong but with individual error; use for trends not absolute values

---

## Exercise Modality Comparisons

**Modality-Specific Adaptations**
- Treadmill running typically elicits slightly higher VO2max than cycle ergometry due to greater active muscle mass and postural demands
- Cycling lower impact, enables higher training volumes with precise power control
- Rowing and cross-country skiing engage large muscle mass; can produce very high VO2max in elite athletes
- Swimming yields lower VO2max values due to horizontal posture and different breathing mechanics

---

## Age-Related Training Considerations (40+)

**HIIT in Older Adults Meta-Analysis**
- HIIT can increase VO2 peak by ~3 mL/kg/min over controls and ~1.8 mL/kg/min more than MICT
- Larger benefits in those starting with low CRF
- Older adults may require more recovery between hard sessions but still respond robustly to both HIIT and MICT

**Midlife CRF & Functional Capacity**
- Maintaining or improving CRF in midlife associated with substantial mortality risk reductions and better functional capacity later
- Central (cardiac output) and peripheral (muscle mass/quality) changes become more limiting from midlife onward
