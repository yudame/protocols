## Key Topics Covered

### Cardiovascular Medications
- **Statins:** Mechanisms, timing, food/supplement interactions, when appropriate
- **Aspirin:** Timing optimization, NSAID interactions, current prevention guidelines

### Evidence-Based Supplements
- **Omega-3/Fish Oil:** Dosing, EPA vs DHA, trial data, atrial fibrillation risk
- **Coenzyme Q10:** Heart failure data, statin interactions, dosing protocols
- **Magnesium:** Blood pressure effects, HRV benefits, forms and dosing
- **Vitamin D:** Cardiovascular evidence (disappointing results)
- **B Vitamins:** Homocysteine hypothesis failure
- **Garlic/Aged Garlic Extract:** Modest blood pressure benefits
- **Plant Sterols/Stanols:** Proven LDL cholesterol lowering
- **Bergamot:** Emerging evidence for lipid modification
- **Red Yeast Rice:** Natural statin alternative (regulatory concerns)

### Supplements with Limited/No Evidence
- **Antioxidant Vitamins (C, E):** Failed trials
- **High-Dose Niacin:** Proven harm
- **Resveratrol:** Hype without human evidence

### Practical Implementation
- **Timing and Interactions:** When to take supplements, drug-supplement interactions
- **Quality and Safety:** Third-party testing (USP, NSF, ConsumerLab)
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** What's worth taking for a 40-year-old man

## Research Methodology

This research followed rigorous evidence-based principles:
- Prioritized peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews
- Distinguished correlation from causation
- Reported effect sizes and practical significance
- Noted study populations and generalizability to healthy 40-year-old men
- Compared individual studies against meta-analyses
- Identified preliminary vs. well-replicated findings
- Noted funding sources and conflicts of interest
- Included contradictory findings and areas of uncertainty
- Cited specific trials (REDUCE-IT, VITAL, Q-SYMBIO, etc.)

## For NotebookLM Audio Generation

Both research files should be uploaded to NotebookLM as separate sources:
1. `research/perplexity-research.md`
2. `research/chatgpt-research.md`

NotebookLM will synthesize across both sources to create a comprehensive audio overview combining the complementary research perspectives.
