## Description
Heart rate variability (HRV) has moved from clinical labs to consumer wearables, offering a powerful window into autonomic nervous system function, stress resilience, and training readiness. This episode synthesizes meta-analyses and systematic reviews to provide an evidence-based playbook for the active 40-year-old man: which metrics actually matter (RMSSD vs SDNN), how to measure reliably with validated devices, when a 15% drop signals overtraining, and which interventions show the largest effect sizes for improving cardiovascular health.
