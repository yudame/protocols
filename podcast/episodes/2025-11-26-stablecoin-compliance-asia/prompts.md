## Setup Phase

**Episode Details:**
- Date: 2025-11-26
- Slug: stablecoin-compliance-asia
- Title: Stablecoin Compliance: Navigating GENIUS Act and MiCA from Asia

---

## Research Phase

### Research Prompt

**Tool Used:** [e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Claude, etc.]

**Prompt:**
```
Research how the US GENIUS Act and EU MiCA regulation create compliance
requirements for a new stablecoin issuer based in Asia seeking global adoption.

**Context:**
- The stablecoin originates in Asia (not subject to US/EU jurisdiction initially)
- As it gains international users/liquidity, US and EU regulations become relevant
- Focus on practical compliance pathways, not theoretical analysis

**Key questions to explore:**
1. What specific triggers bring an Asian stablecoin under GENIUS Act jurisdiction?
   (US users, US exchange listings, USD reserves, US banking relationships)
2. What triggers MiCA compliance requirements for non-EU issuers?
   (EU users, EU exchange listings, euro-denominated offerings)
3. What are the reserve, audit, and disclosure requirements under each framework?
4. How do licensing/authorization requirements work for foreign issuers?
5. What penalties or market access restrictions exist for non-compliance?
6. Are there examples of Asian stablecoin projects navigating this already?

**Research methodology:**
- Prioritize primary sources: actual legislation text, regulatory guidance, official FAQs
- Distinguish between enacted requirements vs. proposed/pending rules
- Note effective dates and transition periods
- Identify areas of regulatory uncertainty or conflicting interpretations
- Compare requirements side-by-side where possible
- Include perspectives from legal/compliance experts and industry participants
- Note any enforcement actions or precedents that clarify requirements

**Output:** Comprehensive research report with specific regulatory citations and source links.

**Prompt:**
```
Create an intellectually rigorous podcast that balances analytical depth with clear explanation.

Opening:
• Begin with "Yudame Research" and introduce the episode topic
• Set up what makes this topic interesting or valuable to explore

Core principles:
• Spell out acronyms on first use: "Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, or MiCA"
• For short, clear terms like MiCA, prefer saying the full phrase in speech when natural
• Medical/technical acronyms (EMT, ART, PPSI, etc.) can remain as acronyms after introduction
• Define technical terms immediately with plain language THEN build on them - assume intelligent but not expert audience
• Use concrete examples and stories ONLY when they exist in the source material - never fabricate or speculate
• When stories exist, include human elements: what people said, felt, decided - not just mechanics
• HIGHLIGHT surprising findings, spectacular failures, and unexpected successes - these are the memorable moments
• Extract frameworks and principles from the research findings
• Connect findings to practical implications and broader patterns
• Maintain scientific rigor: distinguish correlation from causation, note effect sizes, acknowledge uncertainties

What to emphasize:
• Spell-first approach: "The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, called MiCA..." not "MiCA requires..."
• Definition-first explanations: "A Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuer, or PPSI - that's the new license category under GENIUS..."
• Evidence-based analysis: cite specific regulations, note actual penalty amounts, report real deadlines
• Human elements in stories: Tether's choice not to comply, Circle's proactive licensing strategy, GMO's New York trust charter
• Practical insights: what does this mean for someone launching a stablecoin from Asia?
• Pattern recognition: what principles emerge across both regulatory frameworks?
• Conversational check-ins: "Let me define that term..." or "To be clear, what we mean by [X] is..."

SURPRISING MOMENTS - actively look for and highlight these:
• Counter-intuitive findings: "You'd think being offshore protects you, but the moment US users can access your coin..."
• Spectacular consequences: "Tether - the world's largest stablecoin at over $100 billion - got delisted across Europe"
• Dramatic numbers: "$1 million per day per violation" penalties, "60% of reserves must sit in EU banks"
• Unexpected requirements: "Your smart contract needs a kill switch - the ability to freeze specific addresses"
• Hard deadlines: "The grace period ends July 2028 - after that, non-compliant coins are simply banned"
• Reversals: "What everyone thought was a grey area is now explicitly regulated"

Signal these moments with phrases like:
• "Here's where it gets really interesting..."
• "And this is the shocking part..."
• "You wouldn't expect this, but..."
• "The numbers here are staggering..."
• "This completely changes the calculus..."

What to avoid:
• Acronyms without spelling them out first (GENIUS, MiCA, EMT, ART, PPSI, OCC, etc.)
• Technical jargon without immediate plain-language definition
• Legal language when simpler words work
• Concept stacking - introducing 3+ new regulatory terms in one sentence
• Fabricated examples or hypothetical stories not in the research
• Over-simplification that loses regulatory accuracy
• Excessive hedging that obscures clear requirements
• Dry mechanical explanations when case studies exist in the research
• Repeatedly restating context - establish once, then focus on content

Target audience: Intelligent listeners who want to deeply understand stablecoin regulation and apply the insights. They may be founders, investors, or compliance professionals considering the Asian stablecoin market. They appreciate technical depth but need terms defined to follow along.

Tone: Intellectually rigorous but accessible. Think "conversational expert explaining to a bright student" - maintain depth while ensuring clarity.

Closing:
• Summarize 2-3 key takeaways or practical implications
• Close with information about learning more: "Find full research and sources at research dot yuda dot me - that's Y-U-D-A dot M-E"

When presenting case studies:
• Include human drama: "Tether's CTO publicly cited the 60% EU bank requirement as a dealbreaker"
• Build narrative tension: "By mid-2025, exchange after exchange began delisting USDT for European users"
• Make it memorable through specifics: "GMO set up a New York trust company - one of the strictest regulatory regimes"
• Emphasize contrasts: "Circle embraced compliance; Tether said no. Look where each stands in Europe today."

When presenting regulatory requirements:
• Focus on what the rules mean practically
• Use comparisons: "GENIUS requires monthly disclosure; MiCA requires twice-yearly audits"
• Translate requirements to implications: "The 60% EU bank reserve rule means relocating substantial USD holdings"

Balance precision with engagement - neither dumbed down nor unnecessarily complex.

Style: Clean, professional, scientific
Layout: Bold typography with subtle data visualization elements
Color palette: Deep blues and teals with white/silver accents
Concept: An Asian stablecoin project faces a paradox: regulations from jurisdictions where it doesn't operate will determine whether it can achieve global adoption. The US GENIUS Act and EU MiCA regulation tog

Design as a square format (1400x1400px) with space for episode title overlay.
Professional, minimalist aesthetic suitable for Apple Podcasts.
No text in the image - pure visual design.
```

**Revised Prompt:**
```
Create a modern, professional, and scientific square format design (1400x1400px). The concept of the image focuses on the paradox facing an Asian stablecoin project: regulations from jurisdictions where it doesn't operate determining its possibility to achieve global adoption. Dominant color tones should be deep navy blue and dark blue, effectively filling most of the canvas. Use bright teal, white, and silver as subtle accents over the dark blue backdrop. The design should be a pure abstract visualization, without any text, numbers, labels, annotations, icons, logos, symbols, or letterforms. The aesthetic should be minimalist, with a visually clean design devoid of any typography or graphic elements.
