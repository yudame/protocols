## Audio Generation Phase

### NotebookLM Audio Overview Prompt

**Tool Used:** NotebookLM

**Format:** Deep Dive / Long

**Prompt:**
```
Combine vivid storytelling with rigorous analysis - tell compelling stories AND extract the frameworks.

What to emphasize:
• Specific stories with concrete details - the decisions people made, what happened, and why
• Pattern recognition across stories - identify the underlying frameworks and principles
• Both micro (individual decisions) and macro (systemic dynamics) perspectives
• Technical depth where relevant - don't simplify for simplicity's sake
• Counter-intuitive insights and non-obvious connections between events

Target audience: High-IQ protocol builders, founders, investors, and researchers who want both narrative understanding and analytical frameworks.

Tone: Intellectually rigorous but engaging. Use stories to illustrate concepts, then zoom out to extract the patterns. Make it vivid enough to remember the examples, and analytical enough to understand the principles. Think "This happened to Terra/Do Kwon in 2020, which illustrates a broader principle about algorithmic stability..."

Balance the concrete and the abstract - neither dumbed down nor dry.
```

**Customizations:** Standard template with crypto/protocol examples (Terra/Do Kwon, algorithmic stability)
