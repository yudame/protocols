## I. History of Stablecoins: A Year-by-Year Review (2017–2025)

The concept of stablecoins emerged earlier (Tether launched in 2014), but the period starting in 2017 saw significant growth, innovation, crisis, and regulatory attention.

### 2017: The Emergence of Modern Stablecoins

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tether (USDT) circulating supply surpassed $1.4 billion**. DAI (MakerDAO) launched, introducing the decentralized, crypto-collateralized model. Tether suffered a **$31 million treasury hack**. | USDT was the dominant stablecoin, widely used on exchanges as a USD substitute. DAI demonstrated that **over-collateralization** could maintain a peg even with volatile collateral. | **Success:** Tether leveraged speed to market and integration with trading venues to establish a critical network effect. **Pitfall:** Concerns over Tether's reserves and the hack exposed the reputational risk of **lacking transparency** and robust security. |
| *Regulatory Development:* Regulation was nascent, and stablecoins largely flew under the radar. | | |

### 2018: Proliferation of Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A wave of regulated, fiat-backed stablecoins launched, including **USD Coin (USDC)**. Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard (PAX) were approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Algorithmic project **Basis shut down** due to U.S. securities law concerns. Tether (USDT) briefly dropped to **$0.88** amid fears about reserve backing. | USDC and NYDFS-approved coins emphasized transparency and compliance to challenge Tether's opacity. Tether remained the largest, but faced its first real competition. | **Success:** New entrants differentiated themselves through **transparency, monthly reserve attestations**, and aligning with state regulation (NY trust charters) to secure credible backing. **Pitfall:** The failure of Basis taught that innovative algorithmic designs risked being deemed unregistered securities. USDT's de-pegging showed that **confidence vulnerabilities** can cause market turbulence. |
| *Regulatory Development:* NYDFS approvals set a precedent for state-level regulation. SEC guidance caused Basis to return funds, foreshadowing scrutiny of complex token models. | | |

### 2019: Big Tech's Entry and Global Scrutiny

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facebook announced Libra** (June), which placed stablecoins at the top of the G7's policy agenda. Regulators worldwide reacted swiftly and skeptically. **JPM Coin launched** by JPMorgan for internal corporate payments. Tether revealed it had dipped into reserves to cover an affiliate loss, admitting **only 74% cash backing** at one point. Binance USD (BUSD) launched, approved by NYDFS. | Libra became the world's most famous proposed stablecoin, though it never launched. USDC continued steady growth, reaching ~$500 million, indicating rising trust. Tether exceeded $4 billion in supply. | **Success:** JPM Coin showed that working **within existing banking frameworks** faced less resistance than new global currency proposals. **Pitfall:** Libra's high-profile failure demonstrated that **ignoring regulators** and incumbents provokes severe political backlash (governance risk). Tether's reserve scandal highlighted **conflict of interest risk** when using reserve funds for other ventures. |
| *Regulatory Development:* G7 formed a task force; the Financial Stability Board (FSB) began work on global stablecoin recommendations. | | |

### 2020: Rapid Growth Amid Global Uncertainty

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stablecoin market capitalization grew nearly 5×** due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). MakerDAO's DAI faced a severe test on **"Black Thursday"** (March 12), requiring emergency measures and collateral integration (USDC) to restore its peg. **TerraUSD (UST) launched**. Visa announced partnerships to settle transactions in USDC. OCC issued guidance enabling banks to custody stablecoin reserves. | USDT and USDC led the expansion, with USDC growing to over $4 billion. DAI also crossed $1 billion due to DeFi usage. UST and Frax (FRAX) signaled renewed interest in algorithmic and fractional-algorithmic models. | **Success:** The year underscored stablecoins' value proposition as a **flight-to-safety asset** within crypto during market turmoil. **Embracing composability** (integration into DeFi) dramatically boosted demand and circulation (e.g., yield farming). OCC guidance legitimized stablecoins in banking. **Pitfall:** MakerDAO's stress test revealed vulnerabilities in decentralized models relying on volatile collateral. Smaller algorithmic coins failed, indicating that untested designs broke easily under pressure. |
| *Regulatory Development:* FSB issued 10 recommendations for regulating "global stablecoins". The EU drafted the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The STABLE Act was proposed in the U.S., signaling future harsh regulation risk. | | |

### 2021: Mainstream Expansion and Early Cracks

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stablecoin supply soared, reaching $140–$160 billion by year-end. **UST grew rapidly to ~$10 billion**, primarily driven by the **Anchor Protocol's subsidized ~20% APY**. Tether paid $18.5M (NYAG) and $41M (CFTC) in fines for misrepresenting its reserve backing (at times only 27.6% backed). Tether began publishing reserve breakdowns, revealing significant commercial paper holdings. Diem project was wound down. The **U.S. President's Working Group (PWG) report** urged Congress to require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions. | USDT remained dominant, but USDC solidified its second position. UST became the leading algorithmic stablecoin by far. BUSD also grew significantly (to ~$14 B). | **Success:** USDC's strategy of **proactive compliance and transparency** paid off, fueling its role in DeFi and on licensed exchanges. Terra showed that high, subsidized yields could **bootstrap adoption** quickly, demonstrating the power of incentives. **Pitfall:** UST's growth hinged on an **unsustainable, subsidy-fueled yield** (a bubble). Tether's reserve composition (high commercial paper holdings) raised **credit risk** concerns. |
| *Regulatory Development:* Regulatory enforcement actions began (Tether fines). PWG report signaled future regulation requiring bank-like oversight. MiCA framework moved toward approval in the EU. | | |

### 2022: Crisis and Consolidation

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Catastrophic collapse of algorithmic TerraUSD (UST)** in May, wiping out over **$40 billion** in value and shaking the entire crypto sector. UST's algorithmic stabilization mechanism failed. Tether (USDT) briefly de-pegged to **$0.95** but quickly recovered after meeting approximately $10 billion in redemptions. FTX exchange collapsed in November. Japan enacted a law restricting stablecoin issuance to licensed banks/trusts. The EU formally adopted **MiCA**. | UST was removed as a top player, causing algorithmic stablecoins to lose credibility. USDT and USDC emerged stronger, with USDC briefly challenging Tether's market share. Tether eliminated all commercial paper from its reserves, moving entirely to U.S. Treasuries to improve resilience. | **Success:** The collapse proved that only **fully reserved, fiat-backed models** offered stability under extreme stress. Tether validated its **liquidity resilience** by meeting mass redemptions quickly. **Pitfall:** UST demonstrated the **"death spiral" fatal flaw** of algorithmic stablecoins reliant on volatile endogenous assets without robust exogenous backing. Liquidity mismatch risk was highlighted; reserves must be highly liquid to meet mass redemptions. |
| *Regulatory Development:* The UST collapse was a **catalyst for global regulatory action**. US officials cited the crash as evidence stablecoins pose systemic risks. MiCA formally adopted strict reserve and supervision rules. | | |

### 2023: Retrenchment and Regulation

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| USDC briefly **de-pegged to $0.87** in March when $3.3 billion of its reserves were temporarily inaccessible following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The peg was restored after U.S. regulators guaranteed deposits. The **NYDFS ordered Paxos to halt new BUSD issuance** (February) due to oversight concerns. **PayPal launched PYUSD** (August). Europe's MiCA entered its implementation phase. | Tether regained dominance (reaching a new high of ~$83 B) as BUSD wound down and USDC suffered a temporary scar. DAI's backing shifted to incorporate more real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries. Frax moved toward **fully collateralizing FRAX**, abandoning its fractional algorithmic roots. | **Success:** USDC's quick recovery reinforced the value of **transparency and trust**. The SVB incident spurred the strategy to **diversify banking partners** and advocate for direct access to central bank accounts to mitigate traditional finance counterparty risk. PayPal signaled major fintech adoption. **Pitfall:** USDC's depeg exposed the vulnerability of even fully backed stablecoins to **traditional banking counterparty risk** and lack of immediate liquidity. BUSD's forced exit showed that **regulatory compliance is non-optional** for large players. |
| *Regulatory Development:* US federal legislation was drafted (setting stage for GENIUS Act). MiCA and Asian regulators (Hong Kong, Singapore) finalized frameworks enforcing **100% reserve backing**. | | |

### 2024–2025: Toward a Regulated Era

| Major Events | Stablecoin Developments | Key Strategies & Pitfalls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The **U.S. GENIUS Act was signed into law** in July 2025, establishing the first comprehensive federal stablecoin framework. The GENIUS Act mandates **monthly independent audits (attestations)** and executive certification of reserve adequacy. Stablecoin transaction volume reached **$27.6 trillion in 2024**, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. EU MiCA rules became effective in mid-2024. Market cap reached over **$280 billion** by Q3 2025. | The focus is on compliance and obtaining federal/EU authorization. Issuers like Circle and Tether are preparing to meet the new rigorous GENIUS Act standards. | **Success:** Legislative clarity (GENIUS, MiCA) **legitimizes the asset class** and paves the way for greater institutional adoption. The market proved its scale as a global payment rail, exceeding traditional card network volume. **Pitfall:** The GENIUS Act **prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest/yield**, limiting their ability to compete directly with traditional deposit accounts. Regulatory fragmentation persists globally. |

## II. Strategies and Pitfalls for Launching a New Stablecoin

The history of stablecoins provides a clear set of principles, often referred to as the **"Three Pillars of Trust" (Collateral Integrity, Regulatory Compliance, and Code Security)**, necessary for long-term viability.

### A. Successful Growth Strategies

To successfully navigate launching a new stablecoin, companies should focus on the following strategies, which were key to the success of dominant issuers like USDC and Tether (post-2022 improvements):

1.  **Prioritize Regulatory Compliance and Licensing (The Gateway)**:
    *   **Strategy:** View regulation as a **gateway to mainstream adoption**, not an obstacle. Seek federal or recognized licenses (e.g., OCC license under the GENIUS Act or e-money authorization under MiCA in the EU).
    *   **Insight:** Regulatory license is now **more important than first-mover advantage**. Compliant issuers, like USDC, used their regulated status as a competitive differentiator to win institutional trust.

2.  **Ensure Collateral Integrity and Unquestionable Transparency (The Foundation)**:
    *   **Strategy:** Reserves must be 1:1 backed by **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)**, such as U.S. Treasury bills and segregated bank deposits.
    *   **Insight:** Adopt the **mandatory monthly independent audit/attestation standard** required by the GENIUS Act. Transparency beats opacity 100% of the time; continuous disclosure helps prevent panic and reinforces market confidence.

3.  **Guarantee Redeemability and Operational Resilience (The Peg Defense)**:
    *   **Strategy:** Implement mechanisms to ensure **redemption at par value** ($1 per stablecoin) is available **24/7**. Redemption should be streamlined, ideally in under 24 hours, to maintain the peg under stress.
    *   **Insight:** Diversify reserve custodians and banking partners to **mitigate counterparty risk** (e.g., bank failure risk, as seen with USDC/SVB). Swift, transparent responses to market stress can turn a potential collapse into a temporary blip (Circle's response to SVB).

4.  **Leverage Strategic Partnerships and Ecosystem Integration (The Network Effect)**:
    *   **Strategy:** Integrate deeply into key financial ecosystems, including major exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment processors (like Visa or Stripe).
    *   **Insight:** Stablecoins that embrace **composability** (integration into protocols) and are supported by major exchanges and payment networks gain rapid organic demand and network effects.

5.  **Adopt Banking-Level AML/CFT Controls (The Viability Check)**:
    *   **Strategy:** Treat the stablecoin issuing entity as a **financial institution** under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) from day one. Implement robust KYC, sanctions screening (e.g., OFAC), and real-time transaction monitoring across all blockchains the stablecoin operates on.
    *   **Insight:** Securing necessary banking relationships for reserve custody and fiat liquidity hinges on demonstrating a high level of financial crime risk management.

### B. Common Pitfalls and Fatal Flaws

Companies seeking to launch a new stablecoin must actively avoid the following pitfalls, which have historically led to market turbulence or catastrophic failure:

| Pitfall | Historical Example | Lesson / Fatal Flaw |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relying on Algorithmic/No-Collateral Design** | TerraUSD (UST) collapse (2022). | Algorithmic stablecoins without exogenous collateral are **extremely fragile** and highly susceptible to **reflexive runs** and "death spirals" when confidence erodes. |
| **Mixing Peg Stability with Yield Promises** | Anchor Protocol's 20% APY for UST (2021). | **Never mix yield promises with peg stability**. High, unsustainable yields create subsidized bubbles that are vulnerable to collapse. The GENIUS Act explicitly **prohibits issuers from paying interest** or yield on stablecoins. |
| **Lack of Transparency and Partial Backing** | Tether's historical opacity and fines for misrepresenting reserves (2017–2021). | Secrecy regarding reserve composition is a **precursor to fines and de-pegs**. It undermines confidence and violates modern compliance standards like the GENIUS Act's monthly audit mandate. |
| **Operational & Smart Contract Risks** | Tether's 2017 hack, bridge hacks, and DeFi exploits. | **Smart-contract risk** is a mandatory financial control. Use formal verification and rigorous security audits to protect mint/burn processes and keys, as blockchain transactions are irreversible. |
| **Ignoring or Underestimating Regulatory Scrutiny** | Facebook's Libra flop (2019), Basis shutdown (2018), BUSD forced halt (2023). | **Offshore is dead for large issuers**; failure to anticipate and align with global regulatory standards (MiCA, GENIUS) leads to shutdowns, legal actions, and loss of market access. |

## III. Conclusion: The Regulated Path Forward

The period from 2017 to 2025 transformed stablecoins from speculative crypto tools into a class of assets subject to increasing **bank-like prudential regulation**. The disasters of algorithmic stablecoins (UST) and liquidity crises (USDC/SVB) have validated the regulatory consensus that stablecoins designed for payment must be fully backed by HQLA, audited frequently, and issued by regulated entities.

**The overarching lesson for new stablecoin issuers is that long-term success hinges entirely on verifiable, continuous trust**. This is achieved by adhering to regulatory credibility, ensuring operational resilience, and maintaining a conservative reserve structure that prioritizes safety and immediate liquidity over yield or capital efficiency. The passage of the GENIUS Act solidifies this direction, creating a high bar that only compliant, robustly managed digital currencies can clear.

***

*Analogy:* Running a stablecoin successfully in the current era is less like coding a novel software startup and more like **operating a modern-day money market fund or a sophisticated bank settlement system**. Just as a dam must be built with the highest engineering standards and regularly inspected to guarantee it holds back the floodwaters of financial panic, a stablecoin must be **fully collateralized, audited monthly, and licensed** to withstand the pressure of mass redemptions and systemic market stress. The integrity of the structure, verified by independent experts, is the only guarantee of stability.
