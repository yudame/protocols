### Research Prompt

**Tools Used:** Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity

**Prompt:**
```
Research what developmental science identifies as the highest-leverage variables for children ages 4-6, with particular focus on executive function, self-regulation, and process skills versus content mastery.

**Context:** Target audience is parents and educators considering kindergarten approaches. Focus on the 4-6 year age range specifically, as this represents a critical developmental window.

**Research methodology:**
- Prioritize peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, and authoritative sources (e.g., NICHD, developmental psychology journals)
- Distinguish between correlation and causation in findings
- Report effect sizes and practical significance, not just statistical significance
- Note the study populations and whether findings generalize broadly
- Compare individual studies against meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- Identify preliminary research vs. well-replicated findings
- Note funding sources and potential conflicts of interest when relevant
- Include contradictory findings and areas of scientific uncertainty
- Cite specific studies, researchers, and sources throughout

**Key questions to explore:**
1. What does the research say about executive function development at ages 4-6? What predicts strong executive function? What interventions show the largest effect sizes?
2. How does self-regulation develop in this age range, and what supports or undermines it?
3. What is the distinction between "process skills" (learning how to learn) and "content mastery" (specific academic knowledge) at this age? Which predicts better long-term outcomes?
4. What does the evidence show about academic acceleration (early reading, early math instruction) versus developmentally-aligned approaches? Are there tradeoffs?
5. What variables at ages 4-6 best predict long-term academic success, social-emotional health, and life outcomes? Are these the same variables that schools typically prioritize?
6. Are there critical or sensitive periods in this age range where certain interventions are particularly impactful?

**Output:** Comprehensive research report with extensive citations and source links.
